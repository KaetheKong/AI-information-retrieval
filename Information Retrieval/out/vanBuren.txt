  Martin Van Buren  ( Dutch :   Maarten van Buren     [ 2 ]          pronunciation    (  help  ·  info  )  ; December 5, 1782 – July 24, 1862) was an  American  politician who served as the  eighth   President  of the  United States  (1837–1841). A member of the  Democratic Party , he served in a number of senior roles, including  eighth   Vice President  (1833–1837) and  Secretary of State  (1829–1831), both under  Andrew Jackson . Van Buren's inability as president to deal with the economic chaos of the  Panic of 1837  and with the surging  Whig Party  led to his defeat in the 1840 election. 
 Of Dutch descent, Van Buren learned early how to coordinate multiple ethnic and political groups. A meticulous dresser, he could mingle in upper class society as well as in saloon environments such as the tavern his father ran.   [ 3 ]    A delegate to a political convention at age 18, he quickly moved from local to state politics, gaining fame both as a political organizer and an accomplished lawyer. Elected to the Senate by the state legislature in 1821, Van Buren supported  William H. Crawford  for president in 1824, but by 1828 had come to support General Andrew Jackson. Van Buren was a major supporter and organizer for Jackson in the 1828 election. Jackson was elected, and made Van Buren  Secretary of State . 
 During Jackson's eight years as president, Van Buren was a key advisor, and built the organizational structure for the coalescing Democratic Party, particularly in New York. In 1831, Jackson gave him a  recess appointment  as  American minister to Britain , but Van Buren's nomination was rejected by the Senate, cutting short his service in London. He was successful in the jockeying to become Jackson's picked successor, and was elected vice president in 1832. Van Buren faced several Whig opponents in his presidential bid in 1836, and was elected. 
 As president, Van Buren was blamed for the depression of 1837; hostile newspapers called him "Martin Van Ruin". He attempted to cure the economic problems by keeping control of federal funds in an  independent treasury —rather than in state banks—but Congress would not approve of this until 1840. In foreign affairs, he wanted the United States not to annex  Texas  (the 10th president  John Tyler  would annex the state eight years after Van Buren's initial rejection). Additionally, relations with Britain and its colonies in  Canada  proved to be strained from the bloodless  Aroostook War  and the   Caroline  Affair . 
 In 1840, Van Buren was voted out of office, losing to Whig candidate  William Henry Harrison . Van Buren was the leading candidate for the  Democratic nomination in 1844 , but lost to  James K. Polk , who  went on to win the election . In the  1848 election  Van Buren ran unsuccessfully as the candidate of the  Free Soil Party . He also supported fellow Democrats  Franklin Pierce  (1852),  James Buchanan  (1856), and  Stephen A. Douglas  (1860) for the presidency, but his increasingly  abolitionist  views and support for the  Union  led him to support  Abraham Lincoln 's policies after the start of the  American Civil War . 
 Van Buren's health began to fail in 1861, and he died in July 1862 at the age of seventy-nine. Although he served in many high offices, his most lasting achievement was as a political organizer who built the  modern Democratic Party  and guided it to dominance in the new  Second Party System .

Baptismal record from Kinderhook Dutch Reformed Church. Van Buren's name was spelled "Maarten" in Dutch, and he was baptized on December 15, 1782 
 
 
 Born on December 5, 1782, Martin Van Buren was the first president to be born after the United States  declared independence . He was  baptized  on December 15 of that year as "Maarten van Buren", the original  Dutch  spelling of his name. He was born in the village of  Kinderhook, New York , on December 5, 1782, about 20 miles (32 km) south of  Albany  on the  Hudson River . In the era before the steamboat, Kinderhook was an isolated village, and most of the townsfolk, including the Van Burens, were of Dutch descent and spoke Dutch at home. Martin Van Buren was the only president who spoke  English  as  a second language . Van Buren descended from Cornelis Maessen of the town of  Buren  in the Netherlands, who had come to America in 1631 and purchased a plot of land on Manhattan Island; his son, Martin Cornelisen, took the surname Van Buren.   [ 5 ]      [ 6 ]    
 The future president's father, Abraham Van Buren (1737–1817), was a farmer who owned a Kinderhook inn as well as six slaves.   [ 7 ]    Abraham Van Buren supported the American Revolution as a captain in the  Albany County Militia's 7th Regiment ,   [ 8 ]      [ 9 ]    and later joined the Jeffersonian Republicans.   [ 10 ]    He was active in local politics and government, and served as Kinderhook's town clerk from 1787 to 1797.   [ 11 ]    Martin Van Buren's mother was Maria Hoes Van Alen Van Buren (1747–1818). She had been married to Johannes Van Alen. After Johannes' death, she married Abraham Van Buren in 1776. By his mother's first marriage, Van Buren had one half-sister and two half-brothers, including  James I. Van Alen , who practiced law with Van Buren for a time and served as a member of Congress (1807–1809). Van Buren had four full siblings:   [ 12 ]      [ 13 ]    
 
 Dirckie "Derike" Van Buren (1777–1865), the wife of Barent Hoes (1777-1853). Barent Hoes was the brother of Martin Van Buren's wife, and served in local office including town clerk.   [ 14 ]      [ 15 ]      [ 16 ]    
 
 
 Jannetje (Called "Hannah" or "Jane") Van Buren (1780-1838), who never married and resided with her sister Dirckie Van Buren and brother-in-law Barent Hoes.   [ 17 ]    
 
 
 Lawrence Van Buren (1786–1868), an attorney who served as a militia officer in the  War of 1812  and held local offices including  Town Supervisor  of Kinderhook, postmaster, and presidential elector  in 1852 .   [ 18 ]    
 
 
 Abraham Van Buren (1788–1836), an attorney who served as Columbia County Surrogate after Martin Van Buren and James I. Van Alen.   [ 19 ]      [ 20 ]    
 
 Van Buren received a basic education at the village schoolhouse and briefly studied  Latin  at the  Kinderhook Academy  and at  Washington Seminary  in Claverack.   [ 21 ]      [ 22 ]    His formal education ended before he reached 14, when he began  reading law  in 1796 at the office of  Peter Silvester  and his son Francis, prominent  Federalist  attorneys in Kinderhook.   [ 23 ]    
 Van Buren was small in stature; as an adult he was 5 feet 6 inches tall, and often referred to as "Little Van."   [ 24 ]    When he first began his legal studies, he often presented an unkempt appearance in rough, homespun clothing.   [ 25 ]    It was the Silvesters who suggested that Van Buren could improve his professional prospects by dressing fashionably and taking care in how he appeared in public; he heeded the advice and patterned his clothing, appearance, bearing and conduct after theirs.   [ 26 ]      [ 27 ]    After six years under the Silvesters, the elder Silvester and Democratic-Republican political figure  John Peter Van Ness  suggested that Van Buren's political leanings made it a good idea for him to complete his education with a Democratic-Republican attorney. Accepting this advice, he spent a final year of apprenticeship in the  New York City  office of John Van Ness's brother  William P. Van Ness , a political lieutenant of  Aaron Burr .   [ 28 ]    Van Buren was  admitted to the bar  in 1803.   [ 29 ]      [ 30 ]    
 Van Buren married  Hannah Hoes , his childhood sweetheart and first cousin once removed, on February 21, 1807, in  Catskill, New York .   [ 31 ]    Like Van Buren, she was raised in a Dutch home; she spoke primarily Dutch, and spoke English with a distinct accent.   [ 32 ]    The couple had five sons and one daughter:  Abraham  (1807–1873) a graduate of West Point and career military officer;  John  (1810–1866), graduate of Yale and Attorney General of New York; Martin, Jr. (1812–1855), secretary to his father and editor of his father's papers until a premature death from tuberculosis; Winfield Scott (born and died in 1814); and Smith Thompson (1817–1876), an editor and special assistant to his father while president.   [ 33 ]    Their daughter was stillborn.   [ 34 ]    After 12 years of marriage, Hannah Van Buren contracted  tuberculosis  and died on February 5, 1819, at the age of 35.   [ 35 ]    Martin Van Buren never remarried.   [ 36 ]    
  Early political career   [  edit  ]   
 Van Buren had been active in politics from at least the age of 17 when he attended a party convention in  Troy, New York , where he worked successfully to secure for  John Peter Van Ness  the  Democratic-Republican Party  nomination in a special election for the  6th Congressional District  seat.   [ 37 ]    He formed a law partnership with his half-brother  James I. Van Alen , and once established in his practice, he became financially secure enough to increase his focus on politics.   [ 38 ]    He was a supporter of  Aaron Burr , and allied himself with the  George Clinton faction  of the  Democratic-Republican Party . Van Buren supported  Daniel D. Tompkins  for Governor over incumbent  Morgan Lewis  in 1807. Tompkins won, and his allies were a majority in the state legislature. As a result, Van Buren was appointed  Surrogate  of  Columbia County, New York , replacing Van Alen, who had supported Lewis. Van Buren served as Surrogate from 1808 until 1813, when the  Federalist Party  obtained a majority in the state legislature and replaced him.   [ 39 ]      [ 40 ]    
 Van Buren was a member of the  New York State Senate  from 1812 to 1820, and joined the  opposition party  in 1813. (The opposition party were Democratic-Republicans who fought  DeWitt Clinton  for control of the Democratic-Republican Party in New York.) Van Buren served as  New York Attorney General  from 1815 to 1819. He replaced  William Floyd  as a  presidential elector  in  1820 , and voted for  James Monroe  and  Daniel D. Tompkins .   [ 41 ]    
 Though he never served in the military, during the  War of 1812  Van Buren worked in the State Senate to pass war measures, including bills to expand the  New York Militia  and increase soldier pay. In addition, he was a special judge advocate appointed to serve as one of the prosecutors of  William Hull  during Hull's court-martial following the surrender of  Detroit .   [ 42 ]      [ 43 ]    
 At first he opposed DeWitt Clinton's plan for the  Erie Canal , but he supported it when the  Bucktails  (the name given to the anti-DeWitt Clinton Democratic-Republicans) were able to gain a majority on the  Erie Canal Commission , and he supported a bill that raised money for the canal through the sale of state bonds.   [ 44 ]    
 In 1817, Van Buren's connection with so-called "machine politics" started when he created the first political organization encompassing all of New York, the Bucktails.   [ 45 ]    The Bucktails became a successful movement that emphasized party loyalty and used it to capture and control many patronage posts throughout New York. Van Buren gained the nickname of "Little Magician" for the skill with which he exploited what came to be called the " spoils system ". Van Buren served as a member of the 1820 state  constitutional convention , where he favored expanded voting rights, but opposed universal suffrage and tried to maintain property requirements for voting.   [ 46 ]    
 He was the leading figure in the  Albany Regency , a group of Bucktail leaders who for more than a generation dominated the politics of New York and influenced national politics. The Regency, together with other political organizations such as  Tammany Hall , played a major role in expanding the spoils system and making it a recognized and accepted procedure. He was the prime architect of the first nationwide political party: the  Jacksonian Democrats  or  Democratic Party , which evolved from the Democratic-Republicans and relied on party loyalty and patronage to prevent contentious sectional issues, including tariffs and slavery, from becoming national crises. In Van Buren's words, "Without strong national political organizations, there would be nothing to moderate the prejudices between free and slaveholding states."   [ 47 ]    As had  James Madison  and other Democratic Party organizers who favored  states' rights  and local control, Van Buren was struggling to find an institutional solution to the Constitution's seeming inability to prevent concentration of power in an  administrative republic .   [ 48 ]    
 Early in his life Van Buren owned a slave, a man named Tom who served as his personal valet. Tom ran away in 1814 and eventually settled in  Canada , with Van Buren making no effort to locate him. In 1824 Tom was found to be living in  Worcester, Massachusetts . Since he still legally owned Tom (under New York's gradual emancipation law, slavery was scheduled to be completely abolished in the state in 1827), Van Buren agreed to sell Tom to the finder, a resident of  Rensselaer County , for $50 provided that he could be captured without violence. The finder could not make such a guarantee, and his willingness to pay was lessened by the knowledge that Tom would be emancipated in less than three years even if he was re-enslaved, so Tom remained free, as Van Buren probably intended.

Gubernatorial  portrait  of Martin Van Buren. 
 
 
 In  February 1821 , Martin Van Buren was elected a  U.S. Senator from New York , defeating the incumbent  Nathan Sanford  who ran as the  Clintonian  candidate.   [ 51 ]    Van Buren at first favored  internal improvements , such as road repairs and canal construction, proposing a constitutional amendment in 1824 to authorize such undertakings, but changed his position the following year. He voted for the  tariffs  of 1824 and 1828, and then gradually abandoned this protectionist position, later coming out for tariffs "for revenue only."   [ 52 ]    
 In the  presidential election of 1824 , Van Buren supported  William H. Crawford  and received the electoral vote of  Georgia  for  Vice President . None of the presidential candidates—Crawford,  John Quincy Adams ,  Andrew Jackson , or  Henry Clay —had received a majority of the electoral college votes, so  the choice fell  to the  United States House of Representatives . The House had to choose from among the top three candidates, so Clay was eliminated. Van Buren had originally hoped to block  John Quincy Adams  by denying him the state of New York, which was divided between supporters of Crawford and Adams. However, Representative  Stephen Van Rensselaer  swung New York to Adams. Adams won, and appointed Clay as Secretary of State. Because Clay had supported Adams in the House election, Jackson and Crawford supporters alleged corruption.   [ 53 ]    After the House contest, Van Buren shrewdly kept out of  the controversy which followed , and began looking forward to 1828. He switched his support early from Crawford, whose ill health after a stroke had made him a less than viable candidate, to  Andrew Jackson , who had won the popular vote in 1824. Jackson was angered to see the presidency go to Adams after he received fewer votes than Jackson, and Jackson eagerly looked forward to a rematch.   [ 54 ]    
 Always notably courteous in his treatment of opponents, Van Buren showed no bitterness toward either Adams or  Henry Clay , and he voted for Clay's confirmation as  Secretary of State , notwithstanding Jackson's " corrupt bargain " charge.   [ 55 ]      [ 56 ]    At the same time, he opposed the Adams-Clay plans for internal infrastructure improvements (roads, canals, bridges etc.) and declined to support U.S. participation in the  Congress of Panama .   [ 57 ]    As chair of the Judiciary Committee, he brought forward a number of measures for the improvement of judicial procedure, including one (not adopted), which would have required a super-majority vote by the  United States Supreme Court  to declare a law unconstitutional.   [ 58 ]    in May 1826, Van Buren joined with Senator  Thomas Hart Benton  in reporting on patronage in the executive branch, going against his own use of the spoils system to propose unsuccessfully that Presidents not be able to remove officeholders at will, and that Presidents report to Congress on the reasons why dismissed holders of federal positions had been removed.   [ 59 ]    The 1828 " Tariff of Abominations " was recognized as his work. Since Democrats, especially Southerners, were generally opposed to tariffs that increased the price of manufactured goods from the North but did not benefit the raw materials produced in the South, Van Buren could normally have been expected to oppose tariffs. Political observers of the time viewed Van Buren's efforts to pass the 1828 tariff as part of the campaign to elect Jackson as President. Anticipating that most Southerners would vote for Andrew Jackson no matter who else was running, Van Buren intended the tariff proposed by Jackson's Northern Democratic supporters in Congress to attract to Jackson's candidacy Northern voters, who generally favored high tariffs to protect the manufactured goods they produced. Van Buren voted in favor, later adopting the cover story that he had done so only in response to instructions from the  New York State Legislature . Most Democrats, especially Southerners, continued to oppose tariffs after 1828. Van Buren's political opponents in the Democratic Party used his 1828 vote against him for years afterwards to prevent him from obtaining Southern support for his candidacies.   [ 60 ]      [ 61 ]      [ 62 ]    
 Van Buren was not an orator, but his more important speeches show careful preparation and his opinions carried weight; the oft-repeated charge that he refrained from declaring himself on crucial questions is hardly borne out by an examination of his senatorial career. In  February 1827 , he was re-elected to the Senate by a large majority. He became one of the recognized managers of the Jackson campaign, and his tour of  Virginia , the  Carolinas , and  Georgia  in the spring of 1827 won support for Jackson from Crawford. Martin Van Buren sought to reorganize and unify "the old Republican party" behind Jackson.   [ 63 ]    At the state level, Jackson's committee chairs would split up the responsibilities around the state and organize volunteers at the local level. "Hurra Boys" would plant hickory trees (in honor of Jackson's nickname, "Old Hickory") or hand out hickory sticks at rallies. In 1828 Van Buren ran for  Governor of New York  in an effort to use his personal popularity to bolster Jackson's chances of carrying New York in the presidential election. Jackson defeated Adams handily, leading the pro-Adams  New York American  to editorialize "Organization is the secret of victory. By the want of it we have been overthrown."   [ 64 ]    Van Buren won his election, and resigned from the Senate to start the gubernatorial term, which began on January 1, 1829.   [ 65 ]    
 Martin Van Buren's tenure as New York governor is the second shortest on record. While his term was short, he did manage to pass the Bank Safety Fund Law (an early form of deposit insurance) through the Legislature.   [ 66 ]    
  Jackson Cabinet   [  edit  ]   
 On March 5, 1829, President Jackson appointed Van Buren  Secretary of State , an office which probably had been assured to him before the 1828 elections, and Van Buren resigned the governorship on March 12.   [ 67 ]    He was succeeded in the governorship by his Lieutenant Governor,  Enos T. Throop , a member of the Regency. As Secretary of State, Van Buren took care to keep on good terms with the  Kitchen Cabinet , the group of politicians who acted as Jackson's advisers. He sometimes opposed Jackson in the matter of removing political appointees from office to replace them with Jackson loyalists, but also saw to the replacement of Postmasters in New York with Van Buren loyalists.   [ 68 ]    
 He won the lasting regard of Jackson by his courtesies to  Peggy Eaton , wife of  Secretary of War   John H. Eaton , with whom the wives of the cabinet officers led by Vice President Calhoun's wife,  Floride Calhoun  had refused to associate in the  Petticoat Affair .   [ 69 ]      [ 70 ]

 No serious diplomatic questions arose during Van Buren's tenure, but he achieved several notable successes, including the settlement of long-standing claims against France, winning reparations for property that had been seized during the  Napoleonic Wars . He reached an agreement with the British to open trade with the  British West Indies  colonies. In addition, Van Buren completed a treaty with the  Ottoman Empire  that gained American merchants access to the  Black Sea . Items on which he did not achieve success included settling the  Maine - New Brunswick  boundary dispute with Great Britain, gaining settlement of the U.S. claim to the  Oregon Country , concluding a commercial treaty with  Russia , and persuading  Mexico  to sell  Texas .   [ 71 ]      [ 72 ]    
 Van Buren also advised Jackson informally on matters of domestic policy. In the controversy over the  Bank of the United States , he sided with Jackson. He also sided with Jackson on the  Indian Removal Act .   [ 72 ]      [ 73 ]    After the breach between Jackson and Calhoun, which culminated with the  Nullification Crisis , Van Buren's position as one of Jackson's primary political supporters and policy advisors clearly marked him as the most prominent candidate for the vice presidency in 1832, and Jackson's most likely successor in 1836.   [ 74 ]    
  Vice-Presidency   [  edit  ]   
 In December 1829, Jackson had already made known his wish that Van Buren receive the 1832 vice presidential nomination.   [ 75 ]    In April 1831, Van Buren resigned as Secretary of State during the  Petticoat affair , giving Jackson the opportunity to end the dispute by requesting other resignations so he could reorganize his cabinet.   [ 76 ]    Van Buren did not leave office until June, and continued to play a part in the  Kitchen Cabinet .   [ 77 ]    In August 1831 Jackson gave Van Buren a  recess appointment  as  Minister to the Court of St. James (Britain)  and he arrived in London in September.   [ 78 ]    He was cordially received, but in February, he learned that his nomination had been rejected by the Senate on January 25, 1832.   [ 79 ]    The rejection was attributed by the Senate to Van Buren's instructions while Secretary of State to  Louis McLane , the American minister to Britain. Van Buren's instructions, which concerned the opening of the West Indies trade, supposedly repudiated the foreign policy of Jackson's predecessors, which the Senate claimed was a breach of decorum.   [ 80 ]    In fact, the rejection of Van Buren was the work of  Calhoun . Calhoun opposed Van Buren, believing that Van Buren had attempted to keep him from becoming vice president. Calhoun also opposed Van Buren for his role in the Petticoat Affair and his work on the 1828 tariff. When the vote on Van Buren's nomination was taken, enough pro-Calhoun Democrats refrained from voting to produce a tie, thus giving Calhoun, in his role as presiding officer, the ability to cast a vote. He voted no, and so achieved "vengeance" on Van Buren.   [ 81 ]    
 Calhoun was elated, convinced that he had ended Van Buren's career. "It will kill him dead, sir, kill him dead. He will never kick, sir, never kick," Calhoun exclaimed to a friend within earshot of  Thomas Hart Benton .   [ 82 ]    In fact, Calhoun's move backfired by making Van Buren seem the victim of petty politics, thus raising him in both Jackson's regard and the esteem of others in the Democratic Party. Far from ending Van Buren's career, Calhoun's action gave greater impetus to Van Buren's candidacy for vice president.   [ 83 ]    
 After a brief tour of Europe, Van Buren reached New York on July 5, 1832. The May  1832 Democratic National Convention , the party's first, had nominated him for vice president on the Jackson ticket.   [ 84 ]    Van Buren's nomination was not as strongly supported as Jackson's, particularly among southerners who recalled his work on the tariff in 1828, but he somewhat placated southerners by denying the right of Congress to abolish slavery in the  District of Columbia  without the consent of the slave states.   [ 85 ]    
 The Jackson-Van Buren ticket won the 1832 election, and Van Buren took office as Vice President in March 1833.   [ 86 ]    During his time in office Van Buren continued to be one of Jackson's primary advisors and confidants, and accompanied Jackson on his tour of the northeastern United States in 1833.   [ 87 ]    Jackson's confidence in Van Buren was further demonstrated after Jackson named  Benjamin F. Butler , Van Buren's political ally and former law partner, to serve as  Attorney General ,   [ 88 ]    and  John Forsyth , another Van Buren ally, to serve as Secretary of State.   [ 89 ]      [ 90 ]    
 Van Buren's support of Jackson in the Nullification Crisis and the decision not to recharter the Second Bank of the United States made him a target of Jackson's most vocal opponents. Van Buren was threatened with violence, including explicit threats from Senator  George Poindexter  of Mississippi, which caused Van Buren to carry pistols for self-defense. However he also demonstrated both the willingness and the ability to work with his opponents, cooperating with Clay and Calhoun (now a Senator) to pass the compromise  Tariff of 1833 , which helped end the Nullification Crisis.   [ 91 ]    
 During one contentious debate on the bank issue, Van Buren presided over the Senate as Clay spoke passionately about the harm he believed Jackson's bank policy would cause. Directing his remarks to Van Buren, Clay asked rhetorically whether Van Buren would approach Jackson and persuade him to change his mind. After Clay concluded, observers wondered how Van Buren would respond. Rather than answering directly, Van Buren descended from the rostrum and asked Clay if he could borrow a pinch of Clay's  snuff . Caught off guard, Clay reflexively handed over his  snuff box . Van Buren took a pinch, bowed to Clay, and left the chamber, both reducing the effect of Clay's remarks and preventing tension from escalating, as would have happened if Van Buren had attempted to reply to Clay.   [ 92 ]    
  Election of 1836   [  edit  ]   
 Main article:  United States presidential election, 1836  
 In the  election of 1832 , the Jackson-Van Buren ticket won by a landslide.   [ 93 ]    Jackson, not running in 1836, was determined to make Van Buren his successor in order to continue the Jackson administration's policies.   [ 94 ]    
 Van Buren was  unanimously  nominated by the  1835 Democratic National Convention  at  Baltimore, Maryland . On the issue of slavery, Van Buren moved to obtain the support of southerners by assuring them that he opposed abolitionism and supported the maintaining of slavery in states where it had already existed.   [ 95 ]    Regarding the national bank, Van Buren made clear that he opposed rechartering a  national bank .   [ 96 ]    To demonstrate  consistency  regarding his opinions on slavery, Van Buren cast the tie-breaking Senate vote in favor of  engrossing  a bill to subject  abolitionist  mail to state laws, thus ensuring that its circulation would be prohibited in the South.   [ 97 ]    
 Martin Van Buren's competitors  in the 1836 election  were the  Whigs ; they ran several regional candidates in hopes of sending the election to the House of Representatives, where each state delegation would have one vote and the Whigs would stand a better chance of winning.   [ 98 ]     William Henry Harrison  hoped to receive the support of the Western voters,  Daniel Webster  had strength in New England, and  Hugh Lawson White  and  Willie Person Mangum  had support in the South. Van Buren won the election easily, with 170 electoral votes to 73 for Harrison, 26 for White, 14 for Webster and 11 for Mangum.   [ 99 ]    
 Twentieth-century etymologist  Allen Walker Read  published research asserting the wide usage of the phrase "O.K." ( okay ) -- " O ld  K inderhook"—started during the presidential campaign and subsequent presidency of Martin Van Buren.   [ 100 ]

 Martin Van Buren announced his intention "to follow in the footsteps of his illustrious predecessor", and retained all but one of Jackson's cabinet. Van Buren had few economic tools to deal with the  Panic of 1837 . The Panic was followed by a five-year  depression  in which banks failed and  unemployment  reached record highs.   [ 101 ]    Some modern economists have argued that the Panic was caused by the Jackson administration's bank policies, with the power to create money being distributed into decentralized banks (most of which would then continue to cause a massive inflationary bubble).   [ 102 ]    
 Van Buren advocated lower tariffs and free trade, and by doing so maintained support of the South for the Democratic Party. He succeeded in setting up a system of bonds for the national debt. His party was so split that his 1837 proposal for an "Independent Treasury" system did not pass until 1840. It gave the Treasury control of all federal funds and had a legal tender clause that required, by 1843, all payments to be made in  specie , but further inflamed public opinion on both sides.   [ 103 ]    
 In a bold step, Van Buren reversed Andrew Jackson's policies and sought peace at home, as well as abroad. Instead of settling a financial dispute between American citizens and the Mexican government by force, Van Buren wanted to seek a diplomatic solution. In August 1837, Van Buren denied  Texas ' formal request to join the United States, again prioritizing sectional harmony over territorial expansion.   [ 104 ]    This action particularly angered pro-slavery leaders, who thought he did not want to admit Texas as a slave state per the  Missouri Compromise . 
 In the case of the ship   Amistad  , Van Buren sided with the  Spanish government  to return the kidnapped slaves.   [ 105 ]    Regarding Indian removal, Van Buren oversaw the movement of  Cherokee ,  Choctaw ,  Creek ,  Chickasaw  and  Seminole  tribes from  Georgia ,  Tennessee ,  Alabama , and  South Carolina  to the  Oklahoma territory , executing the  orders passed under Jackson .   [ 106 ]    To help secure  Florida , Van Buren also continued the  Second Seminole War , which had begun during Jackson's presidency. Fighting was not resolved until 1842, after Van Buren had left office.   [ 107 ]    
 In 1839,  Joseph Smith, Jr. , the founder of the  Latter Day Saint movement , visited Van Buren to plead for the U.S. to help roughly 20,000 Mormon settlers of  Independence, Missouri  (who were forced from the state during the  1838 Mormon War ) there. The Governor of Missouri,  Lilburn Boggs , had issued  an executive order  on October 27, 1838, known as the "Extermination Order". It authorized troops to use force against Mormons to "exterminate or drive [them] from the state".   [ 108 ]      [ 109 ]    In 1839, after moving to Illinois, Smith and his party appealed to members of Congress and to President Van Buren to intercede for the Mormons. According to Smith's grandnephew, Van Buren said to Smith, "Your cause is just, but I can do nothing for you; if I take up for you I shall lose the vote of Missouri".   [ 110 ]      [ 111 ]    
  Slavery   [  edit  ]   
 While in the state Senate Van Buren voted for a resolution instructing New York's members of Congress to vote against the admission of  Missouri  as a slave state. In  1848  he would be the nominated for president by the  Free Soil Party  (an anti-slavery political party).   [ 112 ]    Despite these antislavery views, during his term of office there was no ambiguity about his position on the abolition of slavery.   [ 113 ]    Van Buren actually considered slavery immoral, but sanctioned by the Constitution.   [ 114 ]    He was against its abolition both in D.C. and in the United States altogether, and said so in his Inaugural Address in 1837: "I believed it a solemn duty fully to make known my sentiments in regard to it [slavery], and now, when every motive for misrepresentation has passed away, I trust that they will be candidly weighed and understood.   [ 115 ]    
 "I must go into the Presidential chair the inflexible and uncompromising opponent of every attempt on the part of Congress to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia against the wishes of the slaveholding States, and also with a determination equally decided to resist the slightest interference with it in the States where it exists."   [ 116 ]    Slavery would be abolished in the District of Columbia on April 18, 1862.   [ 117 ]

  Judicial appointments   [  edit  ]   
 Main article:  Martin Van Buren judicial appointments  
  Supreme Court   [  edit  ]   
 Van Buren appointed two Justices to the  Supreme Court of the United States :   [ 118 ]    
 
  John McKinley  – 1838 
  Peter Vivian Daniel  – 1841 
 
 Van Buren appointed eight other federal judges, all to  United States district courts .   [ 119 ]    
 Some sources incorrectly state that Van Buren appointed  John Catron  to the Supreme Court.   [ 120 ]    Catron was appointed by Jackson on Jackson's last day in office, and confirmed a few days later, after Van Buren's term had begun.   [ 121 ]    
 
    
 
    
 
 
 
  Election of 1840   [  edit  ]   
 Van Buren took the blame for hard times, as Whigs ridiculed him as  Martin Van Ruin . Van Buren's rather elegant personal style was also an easy target for Whig attacks, such as the  Gold Spoon Oration . State elections of 1837 and 1838 were disastrous for the Democrats, and the partial economic recovery in 1838 was offset by a second commercial crisis in that year. Nevertheless, Van Buren controlled his party and was unanimously renominated by the Democrats in 1840. The revolt against Democratic rule led to the  election  of  William Henry Harrison , the  Whig  candidate. Van Buren once mentioned his relief upon leaving office: "As to the presidency, the two happiest days of my life were those of my entrance upon the office and my surrender of it."   [ 122 ]

 On the expiration of his term, Van Buren returned to his estate,  Lindenwald  in Kinderhook, where he planned his return to the White House. He seemed likely to be nominated by the Democrats in 1844, but in April of that year a Van Buren letter to  William H. Hammett  was made public.   [ 123 ]    In it, Van Buren opposed the immediate annexation of  Texas , but said that he would support annexation once the state of war between Texas and  Mexico  was resolved.   [ 124 ]    Van Buren's opposition to immediate annexation cost him the support of pro-slavery Democrats; he began the  Democratic National Convention  with a majority of the delegates, but with no southern support he could not reach the two-thirds threshold required for nomination.   [ 125 ]    His name was withdrawn after eight ballots, and a  dark horse ,  James K. Polk , received the nomination and went on to  win the presidency .   [ 126 ]

 Van Buren was increasingly opposed to slavery, and his original attempts to accommodate pro-slavery southerners gave way over time to acceptance of anti-slavery positions including opposing slavery's expansion into newly organized western states.   [ 127 ]     In 1848, he was nominated for President  by two minor parties, first by the " Barnburner " faction of the Democratic Party in New York, then by the  Free Soil Party , with whom the "Barnburners" coalesced. The Barnburners and Free Soilers opposed Democratic nominee  Lewis Cass , who opposed the  Wilmot Proviso  and was otherwise seen as friendly to slavery.   [ 128 ]    In addition, Van Buren, who had been denied the 1844 nomination by Cass supporters despite having begun the convention with a majority of delegates, may have run in order to exact a measure of revenge by denying Cass the presidency.   [ 129 ]    Van Buren won no electoral votes, but finished second to  Whig  nominee  Zachary Taylor  in New York, taking enough votes from Cass to give the state—and perhaps the election—to Taylor.   [ 130 ]    
 Unlike many anti-slavery Democrats of the 1840s and 1850s, who later joined the  Republican Party , Van Buren and most of his followers remained in the Democratic fold, including his son  John Van Buren  and  Samuel J. Tilden , who later served as Governor of New York and was the Democratic nominee for  President in 1876 .   [ 131 ]      [ 132 ]    Van Buren supported  Franklin Pierce  for President in 1852, and  James Buchanan  in 1856, though he later opposed the Buchanan administration's efforts to accommodate the southern states when they threatened secession.   [ 133 ]      [ 134 ]    
  In the election of 1860 , he supported  Stephen A. Douglas , the candidate of northern Democrats, and helped create a  fusion ticket  in New York of Democratic  electors  pledged to both Douglas and  John C. Breckinridge , but  Abraham Lincoln  carried New York and every northern state except  New Jersey .   [ 135 ]    Once the  American Civil War  began, Van Buren made public his support for the  Union , and supported  Abraham Lincoln 's efforts to prevent the southern states from seceding.   [ 136 ]    In April, 1861 former President Pierce wrote to the other living former Presidents and asked them to consider meeting in order to use their stature and influence to propose a negotiated end to the war. Pierce asked Van Buren to use his role as the senior living ex-President to issue a formal call. Van Buren's reply suggested that Buchanan should be the one to call the meeting, since he was the former President who had served most recently, and nothing more resulted from Pierce's proposal.   [ 137 ]    
 Van Buren's health began to fail later in 1861, and he was bedridden with pneumonia during the fall and winter of 1861-1862.   [ 138 ]    He did not recover, and died of bronchial  asthma  and  heart failure  at his Lindenwald estate in Kinderhook at 2:00 a.m. on July 24, 1862 at the age of 79.   [ 139 ]    He is buried in the  Kinderhook Reformed Dutch Church  Cemetery, as are his wife Hannah, his parents, and his son Martin Van Buren, Jr.   [ 140 ]      [ 141 ]

[ 171 ]      [ 172 ]    
 On the television show   Seinfeld  , the episode " The Van Buren Boys " is about a fictional  street gang  that admires Van Buren and bases its rituals and symbols on him, including the hand sign of eight fingers pointing up. Eight fingers signifies Van Buren, the eighth President.   [ 173 ]
