  george walker bush  (born july 6, 1946) is an  american   politician  and  businessman  who served as the  43rd   president of the united states  from 2001 to 2009, and the  46th governor of texas  from 1995 to 2000. the eldest son of  barbara  and  george h. w. bush , he was born in  new haven, connecticut . after graduating from  yale university  in 1968 and  harvard business school  in 1975, he worked in oil businesses. he married  laura welch  in 1977 and ran unsuccessfully for the  house of representatives  shortly thereafter. he later co-owned the  texas rangers  baseball team before defeating  ann richards  in the  1994 texas gubernatorial election . he was elected president in 2000 after a  close and controversial election , becoming the fourth president to be elected while receiving fewer popular votes nationwide than his opponent.   [ 6 ]    he is the second president to have been the son of a former president, the first having been  john quincy adams .   [ 7 ]    he is also the brother of  jeb bush , who is a former  governor of florida  and candidate for the  republican  presidential nomination in the  2016 presidential election . 
 eight months into bush's first term as president, the  september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks  occurred. bush responded by  launching  the " war on terror ", an international military campaign which included the  war in afghanistan , launched in 2001 and the  war in iraq , launched in 2003. he also promoted policies on the economy, health care, education, social security reform, and  amending  the  constitution  to prohibit  same-sex marriage .   [ 8 ]    he signed into law  broad tax cuts , the  patriot act , the  no child left behind act , the  partial-birth abortion ban act ,  medicare  prescription drug benefits for seniors, and funding for the  aids  relief program known as  pepfar . his tenure saw national debates on  immigration ,  social security ,  electronic surveillance , and  torture . 
 bush successfully ran for re-election against democratic senator  john kerry  in  2004 , in another relatively close election. after his re-election, bush received increasingly heated  criticism  from across the  political spectrum    [ 9 ]      [ 10 ]      [ 11 ]    for his handling of the iraq war,  hurricane katrina ,   [ 12 ]      [ 13 ]      [ 14 ]    and other challenges. amid this criticism, the  democratic party  regained control of congress in the  2006 elections . in december 2007, the united states entered its longest post- world war ii  recession, often referred to as the " great recession ," prompting the bush administration to obtain congressional passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system. nationally, bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular presidents in history, having received the highest recorded presidential approval ratings in the wake of the september 11 attacks, as well as one of the lowest approval ratings during the  2008 financial crisis .   [ 15 ]    he was met with public protests even occurring during visits to the united kingdom.   [ 16 ]    
 bush left office in 2009 and since then, he has returned to texas and purchased a home in a suburban area of  dallas . he is currently a public speaker, has written a  memoir  titled   decision points  ,   [ 17 ]    has taken up painting as a hobby, and  his presidential library  was opened in 2013. his presidency has been ranked among the worst in recent  surveys of presidential scholars .

george w. bush with his parents, barbara and george h. w. bush, c. 1947 
 
 
 george walker bush was born on july 6, 1946, at grace-new haven hospital (now  yale–new haven hospital ) in  new haven, connecticut ,   [ 21 ]    as the first child of  george herbert walker bush  and  barbara pierce . he was raised in  midland  and  houston, texas , with four siblings,  jeb ,  neil ,  marvin  and  dorothy . another younger sister, robin, died from  leukemia  at the age of three in 1953.   [ 22 ]    his grandfather,  prescott bush , was a u.s. senator from  connecticut .   [ 23 ]    his father george h. w. bush was  ronald reagan 's vice president from 1981 to 1989 and the 41st u.s. president from 1989 to 1993. bush has  english  and some  german  ancestry, along with more distant  dutch ,  welsh ,  irish ,  french , and  scottish  roots.   [ 24 ]    
 bush attended public schools in midland, texas, until the family moved to houston after he had completed his 7th grade year. he then went to  the kinkaid school , a  prep school  in houston for two years.   [ 25 ]    
 bush finished high school at the  phillips academy , a  boarding school  (then all-male) in  andover, massachusetts , where he played baseball and, during his senior year, was the head cheerleader.   [ 26 ]      [ 27 ]    he attended  yale university  from 1964 to 1968, graduating with a  b.a.  degree in  history .   [ 28 ]    during this time, he was a cheerleader and a member of the  delta kappa epsilon , serving as the fraternity's president during his senior year.   [ 29 ]      [ 30 ]      [ 31 ]    bush became a  member  of the  skull and bones  society as a senior.   [ 32 ]    bush was a  rugby union  player and was on yale's 1st xv.   [ 33 ]    he characterized himself as an average student.   [ 34 ]    his average during his first three years at yale was 77 and he had a similar average under a nonnumeric rating system in his final year.   [ 35 ]    
 beginning in the fall of 1973, bush attended the  harvard business school , where he earned an  m.b.a.  degree. he is the only u.s. president to have earned an m.b.a.   [ 36 ]

 in may 1968, bush was commissioned into the  texas air national guard .   [ 37 ]    after two years of active-duty service while training,   [ 38 ]    he was assigned to houston, flying  convair   f-102s  with the  147th reconnaissance wing  out of the  ellington field joint reserve base .   [ 37 ]      [ 39 ]    critics, including former  democratic national committee  chairman  terry mcauliffe , have alleged that bush was favorably treated due to his father's political standing as a member of the  house of representatives , citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance.   [ 40 ]    in june 2005, the  united states department of defense  released all the records of bush's texas air national guard service, which remain in its official archives.   [ 41 ]    
 in late 1972 and early 1973, he  drilled  with the  187th fighter wing  of the  alabama air national guard , having moved to  montgomery, alabama , to work on the unsuccessful u.s. senate campaign of republican  winton m. blount .   [ 42 ]      [ 43 ]    in 1972, bush was suspended from flying for failure to take a scheduled physical exam.   [ 44 ]    he was honorably discharged from the air force reserve on november 21, 1974.   [ 45 ]

 at a backyard barbecue in 1977, friends introduced him to  laura lane welch , a school teacher and librarian. bush proposed to her after a three-month courtship, and they married on november 5 of that year.   [ 46 ]    the couple settled in midland, texas. bush left his family's  episcopal church  to join his wife's  united methodist church .   [ 2 ]    on november 25, 1981, laura bush gave birth to  fraternal twin  daughters,  barbara pierce bush  and  jenna welch bush ;   [ 46 ]    they graduated from high school in 2000 and from  yale university  and the  university of texas at austin , respectively, in 2004.

 prior to his marriage, bush had multiple episodes of alcohol abuse.   [ 47 ]    in one instance, on september 4, 1976, he was arrested near his family's summer home in  kennebunkport , maine, for driving under the influence of alcohol. he pleaded guilty, was fined $150 and had his maine driver's license briefly suspended.   [ 48 ]    bush says his wife has had a stabilizing effect on his life,   [ 46 ]    and attributes to her influence his 1986 decision to give up alcohol.   [ 49 ]    while governor of texas, bush said of his wife, "i saw an elegant, beautiful woman who turned out not only to be elegant and beautiful, but very smart and willing to put up with my rough edges, and i must confess has smoothed them off over time."   [ 46 ]    
 bush has been an avid reader throughout his adult life, preferring biographies and histories.   [ 50 ]    during his time as president, bush read the  bible  daily.   [ 51 ]    he also read 14  lincoln biographies  and, during the last three years of his presidency, he reportedly read 186 books. a reporter recalls seeing "books by  john fowles ,  f. scott fitzgerald ,  james joyce , and  gore vidal  lying about, as well as biographies of  willa cather  and  queen victoria " in his home when bush was a texas oilman. other hobbies include cigar smoking and golf.   [ 52 ]    since leaving the white house, bush has also taken up oil painting.   [ 53 ]    
 his first granddaughter, margaret laura "mila" hager, was born to his daughter  jenna bush  on april 14, 2013. she is named after her two grandmothers.   [ 54 ]

 in 1978, bush ran for the  house of representatives  from  texas's 19th congressional district . his opponent,  kent hance , portrayed him as out of touch with rural texans. bush lost the election by 6,000 votes (6 percent) of the 103,000 votes cast.   [ 55 ]    he returned to the oil industry and began a series of small, independent oil exploration companies.   [ 56 ]    he created  arbusto energy ,   [ 57 ]    and later changed the name to bush exploration. in 1984, his company merged with the larger  spectrum 7 , and bush became chairman.   [ 56 ]    the company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into  hkn, inc.    [ 56 ]      [ 58 ]    bush served on the board of directors for hkn.   [ 56 ]    questions of possible  insider trading  involving hkn arose, but the  securities and exchange commission's  (sec) investigation concluded that the information bush had at the time of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.   [ 56 ]      [ 59 ]    
 bush moved his family to washington, d.c. in 1988 to work on his father's campaign for the u.s. presidency.   [ 60 ]      [ 61 ]    he served as a campaign adviser and liaison to the media;   [ 56 ]    he assisted his father by campaigning across the country.   [ 56 ]    returning to texas after the successful campaign, he purchased a share in the  texas rangers  baseball franchise in april 1989, where he served as managing general partner for five years.   [ 62 ]    he actively led the team's projects and regularly attended its games, often choosing to sit in the open stands with fans.   [ 63 ]    bush's sale of his shares in the rangers in 1998 brought him over $15 million from his initial $800,000 investment.   [ 64 ]    
 in december 1991, bush was one of seven people named by his father to run his father's 1992 presidential re-election campaign as "campaign advisor".   [ 65 ]    the prior month, his father asked him to tell white house chief of staff  john h. sununu  that he should resign.   [ 66 ]

 as bush's brother, jeb, sought the governorship of florida, bush declared his candidacy for the 1994 texas gubernatorial election. his campaign focused on four themes: welfare reform,  tort reform , crime reduction, and education improvement.   [ 56 ]    bush's campaign advisers were  karen hughes ,  joe allbaugh , and  karl rove .   [ 67 ]    
 after easily winning the republican primary, bush faced popular democratic incumbent governor  ann richards .   [ 56 ]      [ 68 ]    in the course of the campaign, bush pledged to sign a bill allowing texans to obtain  permits to carry concealed weapons . richards had vetoed the bill, but bush signed it after he became governor.   [ 69 ]    according to   the atlantic monthly  , the race "featured a rumor that she was a lesbian, along with a rare instance of such a tactic's making it into the public record—when a regional chairman of the bush campaign allowed himself, perhaps inadvertently, to be quoted criticizing richards for 'appointing avowed  homosexual activists ' to state jobs".   [ 70 ]     the atlantic , and others, connected the lesbian rumor to karl rove,   [ 71 ]    but rove denied being involved.   [ 72 ]    bush won the general election with 53.5 percent against richards' 45.9 percent.   [ 73 ]    
 bush used a budget surplus to push through texas's largest tax-cut, $2 billion.   [ 67 ]    he extended government funding for organizations providing education of the dangers of alcohol and drug use and abuse, and helping to reduce  domestic violence .   [ 74 ]    critics contended that during his tenure, texas ranked near the bottom in environmental evaluations. supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores.   [ 56 ]    
 in 1999, bush signed a state law obliging electric retailers to buy a  certain amount of energy from renewable sources (rps) ,   [ 75 ]      [ 76 ]      [ 77 ]    which helped  texas  eventually become the  leading producer  of  wind powered  electricity in the u.s.   [ 78 ]      [ 79 ]      [ 80 ]    
 in 1998, bush won re-election with a record   [ 56 ]    69 percent of the vote.   [ 81 ]    he became the first governor in texas history to be elected to two consecutive four-year terms.   [ 56 ]    for most of texas history, governors served two-year terms; a  constitutional amendment  extended those terms to four years starting in 1975.   [ 82 ]    in his second term, bush promoted faith-based organizations and enjoyed high approval ratings.   [ 56 ]    he proclaimed june 10, 2000 to be  jesus day  in texas, a day on which he "urge[d] all texans to answer the call to serve those in need".   [ 83 ]    
 throughout bush's first term, national attention focused on him as a potential future presidential candidate. following his re-election, speculation soared.   [ 56 ]    within a year, he decided to seek the 2000 republican presidential nomination.

 in june 1999, while governor of texas, bush announced his candidacy for president of the united states. with no incumbent running, bush entered a large field of candidates for the republican party presidential nomination consisting of  john mccain ,  alan keyes ,  steve forbes ,  gary bauer ,  orrin hatch ,  elizabeth dole ,  dan quayle ,  pat buchanan ,  lamar alexander ,  john kasich , and  robert c. smith . 
 bush portrayed himself as a  compassionate conservative , implying he was more centrist than other republicans. he campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the white house, increasing the size of the  united states armed forces , cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities.   [ 56 ]    by early 2000, the race had centered on bush and mccain.   [ 56 ]    
 bush won the  iowa caucuses , but, although he was heavily favored to win the  new hampshire primary , he trailed mccain by 19 percent and lost that primary. despite this, bush regained momentum and, according to political observers, effectively became the front runner after the  south carolina primary , which according to   the boston globe   made history for his campaign's negativity;   the new york times   described it as a  smear campaign .   [ 84 ]      [ 85 ]      [ 86 ]    
  general election  
 on july 25, 2000, bush surprised some observers by asking  dick cheney , a former  white house chief of staff ,  u.s. representative , and  secretary of defense , to be his  running mate . cheney was then serving as head of bush's vice-presidential search committee. soon after, bush and cheney were officially nominated by the republican party at the  2000 republican national convention . 
 bush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as governor of texas.   [ 56 ]    bush's campaign criticized his democratic opponent, incumbent vice president  al gore , over  gun control  and taxation.   [ 87 ]    
 when the election returns came in on november 7, bush won 29 states, including florida. the closeness of the florida outcome led to a  recount .   [ 56 ]    the initial recount also went to bush, but the outcome was tied up in courts for a month until reaching the  u.s. supreme court .   [ 88 ]    on december 9, in the controversial   bush v. gore   ruling,   [ 89 ]    the court reversed a  florida supreme court  decision ordering a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on the argument that the use of different standards among florida's counties violated the  equal protection clause  of the  fourteenth amendment .   [ 56 ]    the machine recount showed that bush had won the florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast.   [ 90 ]    although he received 543,895 fewer individual votes than gore nationwide, bush won the election, receiving 271  electoral votes  to gore's 266.   [ 90 ]

 in 2004, bush commanded broad support in the republican party and did not encounter a primary challenge. he appointed  ken mehlman  as campaign manager, with a political strategy devised by  karl rove .   [ 91 ]    bush and the republican platform included a strong commitment to the wars in iraq and afghanistan,   [ 92 ]    support for the  usa patriot act ,   [ 93 ]    a renewed shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion and  same-sex marriage ,   [ 92 ]      [ 94 ]    reforming  social security  to create private investment accounts,   [ 92 ]    creation of an  ownership society ,   [ 92 ]    and opposing mandatory carbon emissions controls.   [ 95 ]    bush also called for the implementation of a  guest worker program  for immigrants,   [ 92 ]    which was criticized by conservatives.   [ 96 ]    
 the bush campaign advertised across the u.s. against democratic candidates, including bush's emerging opponent, massachusetts senator  john kerry . kerry and other democrats attacked bush on the  iraq war , and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth. the bush campaign portrayed kerry as a staunch  liberal  who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. the bush campaign continuously criticized kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in iraq,   [ 56 ]    and argued that kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the war on terror. 
 in the election, bush carried 31 of 50 states, receiving a total of 286  electoral votes . he won an outright majority of the popular vote (50.7 percent to his opponent's 48.3 percent).   [ 97 ]    the previous president to win an outright majority of the popular vote was bush's father in the 1988 election. additionally, it was the first time since  herbert hoover 's  election in 1928  that a republican president was elected alongside re-elected republican majorities in both houses of congress.

 though bush originally outlined an ambitious domestic agenda, his priorities were significantly altered following the  september 11 terrorist attacks  in 2001.   [ 98 ]    wars were waged in afghanistan and iraq with significant domestic debates regarding immigration, healthcare, social security, economic policy, and treatment of terrorist detainees. over an eight-year period, bush's once-high approval ratings   [ 99 ]    steadily declined, while his disapproval numbers increased significantly.   [ 100 ]    in 2007, the united states entered the longest post-world war ii recession.   [ 101 ]

 bush took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting of the  dot-com bubble .   [ 102 ]    the terrorist attacks also impacted the economy. the bush administration increased federal  government spending  from $1.789 trillion to $2.983 trillion (60 percent) while revenues increased from $2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008). individual income tax revenues increased by 14 percent, corporate tax revenues by 50 percent, customs and duties by 40 percent. discretionary defense spending was increased by 107 percent, discretionary domestic spending by 62 percent, medicare spending by 131 percent, social security by 51 percent, and income security spending by 130 percent. cyclically adjusted, revenues rose by 35 percent and spending by 65 percent.   [ 103 ]    
 
    
 
    
president bush signing a $1.35 trillion  tax cut into law , june 7, 2001 
 
 
 the increase in spending was more than under any predecessor since  lyndon b. johnson .   [ 104 ]    the number of  economic regulation  governmental workers increased by 91,196.   [ 105 ]    
 the surplus in fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion—the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever.   [ 106 ]    in 2001, bush's budget estimated that there would be a $5.6 trillion surplus over the next ten years.   [ 107 ]    facing congressional opposition, bush held townhall style meetings across the u.s. in order to increase public support for his plan for a $1.35 trillion  tax cut program —one of the largest tax cuts in u.s. history.   [ 56 ]    bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers, saying "the surplus is not the government's money. the surplus is the people's money."   [ 56 ]    federal reserve chairman  alan greenspan  warned of a recession and bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs.   [ 108 ]    treasury secretary  paul o'neill , opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine  social security .   [ 109 ]    o'neill disputes the claim, made in bush's book  decision points , that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts.   [ 110 ]    by 2003, the economy showed signs of improvement, though job growth remained stagnant.   [ 56 ]     another tax cut program  was passed that year. 
 during the 2001 to 2008 years, gdp grew at an average annual rate of 2.125 percent,   [ 111 ]    less than for past business cycles.   [ 112 ]    
 bush entered office with the  dow jones industrial average  at 10,587, and the average peaked in october 2007 at over 14,000. when bush left office, the average was at 7,949, one of the lowest levels of his presidency.   [ 113 ]    
 
    
 
    
 deficit  and  debt  increases 2001–2009. gross debt has increased over $500 billion each year since fy2003. 
 
 
 unemployment originally rose from 4.2 percent in january 2001 to 6.3 percent in june 2003, but subsequently dropped to 4.5 percent as of july 2007.   [ 114 ]    adjusted for inflation,  median household income  dropped by $1,175 between 2000 and 2007,   [ 115 ]    while professor ken homa of  georgetown university  has noted that "median real after-tax household income went up 2%".   [ 116 ]    the poverty rate increased from 11.3 percent in 2000 to 12.3 percent in 2006 after peaking at 12.7 percent in 2004.   [ 117 ]    by october 2008, due to increases in spending,   [ 118 ]     the national debt  had risen to $11.3 trillion,   [ 119 ]    an increase of over 100 percent from 2000 when the debt was only $5.6 trillion.   [ 120 ]      [ 121 ]    most debt was accumulated as a result of what became known as the " bush tax cuts " and increased national security spending.   [ 122 ]    in march 2006, then-senator  barack obama  said when he voted against raising the  debt ceiling : "the fact that we are here today to debate raising america's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure."   [ 123 ]    by the end of bush's presidency, unemployment climbed to 7.2 percent.   [ 124 ]    
 in december 2007, the united states entered the longest post– world war ii  recession,   [ 125 ]    which included a  housing market correction , a  subprime mortgage crisis ,  soaring oil prices , and a declining dollar value.   [ 126 ]    in february, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record.   [ 127 ]      [ 128 ]    to aid with the situation, bush signed a $170 billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. the bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of  fannie mae  and  freddie mac  in 2003,   [ 129 ]    and after two years, the regulations passed the house but died in the senate. many republican senators, as well as influential members of the bush administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices.   [ 130 ]      [ 131 ]      [ 132 ]    in september 2008,  the crisis became much more serious  beginning with the government takeover of  fannie mae and freddie mac  followed by the collapse of  lehman brothers  and a federal bailout of  american international group  for $85 billion.   [ 133 ]    
 many economists and world governments determined that the situation became the worst financial crisis since the  great depression .   [ 134 ]      [ 135 ]    additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according to former federal reserve chairman  alan greenspan .   [ 136 ]    bush, meanwhile, proposed a  financial rescue plan  to buy back a large portion of the u.s. mortgage market.   [ 137 ]    vince reinhardt, a former federal reserve economist now at the  american enterprise institute , said "it would have helped for the bush administration to empower the folks at treasury and the federal reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the  fdic  to look at these issues more closely", and additionally, that it would have helped "for congress to have held hearings".   [ 131 ]    
 in november 2008, over 500,000 jobs were lost, which marked the largest loss of jobs in the united states in 34 years.   [ 138 ]    the  bureau of labor statistics  reported that in the last four months of 2008, 1.9 million jobs were lost.   [ 139 ]    by the end of 2008, the u.s. had lost a total of 2.6 million jobs.   [ 140 ]    
  education and health  
 bush undertook a number of educational priorities, such as increasing the funding for the  national science foundation  and  national institutes of health  in his first years of office, and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for american high school students. funding for the nih was cut in 2006, the first such cut in 36 years, due to rising inflation.   [ 141 ]    
 
    
 
    
president bush signing the  no child left behind act  into law, january 2002 
 
 
 one of the administration's early major initiatives was the  no child left behind act , which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance, provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools, and target more federal funding to low-income schools. this landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support, including that of senator  ted kennedy  of  massachusetts .   [ 142 ]    it was signed into law by bush in early 2002.   [ 143 ]    many contend that the initiative has been successful, as cited by the fact that students in the u.s. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since bush signed "no child left behind" into law.   [ 144 ]    critics argue that it is underfunded   [ 145 ]    and that nclba's focus on "high-stakes testing" and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive.   [ 146 ]    
 after being re-elected, bush signed into law a  medicare  drug benefit program that, according to  jan crawford greenburg , resulted in "the greatest expansion in america's  welfare state  in forty years;" the bill's costs approached $7 trillion.   [ 147 ]    in 2007, bush opposed and vetoed  state children's health insurance program  (schip) legislation, which was added by the democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by congress. the schip legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some low-income families from about six million to ten million children. it was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax.   [ 148 ]    bush viewed the legislation as a move toward  socialized health care , and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as $83,000 per year who did not need the help.   [ 149 ]    
  social services and social security  
 following republican efforts to pass the  medicare act of 2003 , bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the  medicare  program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits.   [ 150 ]    the retired persons lobby group  aarp  worked with the bush administration on the program and gave their endorsement. bush said the law, estimated to cost $400 billion over the first ten years, would give the elderly "better choices and more control over their health care".   [ 151 ]    
 
    
 
    
president bush discussing social security reform at the lake nona ymca family center in orlando, florida, march 18, 2005 
 
 
 bush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to reform social security,   [ 152 ]    which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005. bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the u.s. congress.   [ 152 ]    in his  2005 state of the union address , bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program, which included partial privatization of the system, personal social security accounts, and options to permit americans to divert a portion of their social security tax ( fica ) into secured investments.   [ 152 ]    democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system.   [ 152 ]    
 bush embarked on a 60-day national tour, campaigning for his initiative in media events known as "conversations on social security", in an attempt to gain public support.   [ 153 ]    nevertheless, public support for the proposal declined   [ 154 ]    and the house republican leadership decided not to put social security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda.   [ 155 ]    the proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished by the political fallout from  hurricane katrina  in the fall of 2005.   [ 156 ]    after the democrats gained control of both houses of congress as a result of the  2006 midterm elections , there was no prospect of further congressional action on the bush proposal for the remainder of his term in office. 
  environmental policies  
 main article:  domestic policy of the george w. bush administration § environment  
 upon taking office in 2001, bush stated his opposition to the  kyoto protocol , an amendment to the  united nations framework convention on climate change  which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing  greenhouse gas  emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80 percent of the world's population   [ 157 ]    and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year.   [ 158 ]    he also cited that the senate had voted 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol. 
 
    
 
    
president bush delivering a statement on energy, urging congress to end  offshore oil drill  ban, june 18, 2008 
 
 
 in may 2001, bush signed an  executive order  to create an inter-agency task force to streamline energy projects,   [ 159 ]    and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues.   [ 160 ]    
 in 2002, bush announced the  clear skies act of 2003 ,   [ 161 ]    aimed at amending the  clean air act  to reduce air pollution through the use of  emissions trading  programs. many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal.   [ 162 ]    the initiative was introduced to congress, but failed to make it out of committee. 
 bush has said that he believes that  global warming  is real   [ 163 ]    and has noted that it is a serious problem, but he asserted there is a "debate over whether it's man-made or naturally caused".   [ 164 ]    the bush administration's stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities. critics have alleged that the administration   [ 165 ]    misinformed the public and did not do enough to reduce  carbon emissions  and deter global warming.   [ 166 ]    
  energy policies  
 in his  2006 state of the union address , bush declared, "america is addicted to oil" and announced his advanced energy initiative to increase  energy development  research.   [ 167 ]    
 that same year, bush declared the  northwestern hawaiian islands  a national monument, creating the largest  marine reserve  to date. the  papah?naumoku?kea marine national monument  comprises 84 million acres (340,000 km 2 ) and is home to 7,000 species of fish, birds, and other marine animals, many of which are specific to only those islands.   [ 168 ]    the move was hailed by conservationists for "its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area".   [ 169 ]

 in his  2007 state of the union address , bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing  fossil fuel  consumption and increasing  alternative fuel  production.   [ 170 ]    amid high gasoline prices in 2008, bush lifted a ban on  offshore drilling .   [ 171 ]    however, the move was largely symbolic as there is still a federal law banning offshore drilling. bush said, "this means that the only thing standing between the american people and these vast oil reserves is action from the u.s. congress."   [ 171 ]    bush had said in june 2008, "in the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. my administration has worked with congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen  fuel cells .... in the short run, the american economy will continue to rely largely on oil. and that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. so my administration has repeatedly called on congress to expand domestic oil production."   [ 172 ]    
 in his  2008 state of the union address , bush announced that the u.s. would commit $2 billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, "along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like india and china, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive." he also announced plans to reaffirm the united states' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the un, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, "this agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride."   [ 173 ]    
  stem cell research and first use of veto power  
 federal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the  department of health and human services  and the  national institutes of health  has been forbidden by law since the passage in 1995 of the  dickey-wicker amendment  by congress and the signature of president  bill clinton .   [ 174 ]    bush has said that he supports adult  stem cell  research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research. however, bush did not support  embryonic stem cell  research.   [ 175 ]    on august 9, 2001, bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing "lines" of stem cells,   [ 176 ]    but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned. testing can only be done on 12 of the original lines, and all of the approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells, which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines.   [ 177 ]    on july 19, 2006, bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the  stem cell research enhancement act . the bill would have repealed the dickey-wicker amendment, thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo.   [ 178 ]    
  genetic nondiscrimination  
 on may 21, 2008 president george w. bush signed into law the  genetic information nondiscrimination act  (gina).   [ 179 ]      [ 180 ]    the bill protects americans against discrimination based on their genetic information when it comes to health insurance and employment. the issue had been debated for 13 years before becoming law. it is designed to protect citizens while not hindering genetic research. 
  immigration

 nearly 8 million immigrants came to the united states from 2000 to 2005, more than in any other five-year period in the nation's history.   [ 181 ]    almost half entered illegally.   [ 182 ]    in 2006, bush urged congress to allow more than 12 million  illegal immigrants  to work in the united states with the creation of a "temporary guest-worker program". bush also urged congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying 6,000  national guard  troops to the  mexico–united states border .   [ 183 ]    from may to june 2007, bush strongly supported the  comprehensive immigration reform act of 2007 , which was written by a bipartisan group of senators with the active participation of the bush administration.   [ 184 ]    the bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants, with an eventual path to citizenship; establishing a guest worker program; a series of border and work site enforcement measures; a reform of the  green card  application process and the introduction of a point-based "merit" system for green cards; elimination of " chain migration " and of the  diversity immigrant visa ; and other measures. bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of u.s. laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation, and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor.   [ 185 ]    bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty.   [ 186 ]    
 a heated public debate followed, which resulted in a substantial rift within the republican party, most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions.   [ 187 ]    the bill was eventually defeated in the senate on june 28, 2007, when a  cloture  motion failed on a 46–53 vote.   [ 188 ]    bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives.   [ 189 ]    the bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law.   [ 190 ]    
 on september 19, 2010, former israeli prime minister  ehud olmert  said that bush offered to accept 100,000 palestinian refugees as american citizens if a permanent settlement had been reached between israel and the palestinian authority.   [ 191 ]

  hurricane katrina , one of the most damaging natural disasters in u.s. history, struck early in bush's second term. katrina formed in late august during the 2005  atlantic  hurricane season and devastated much of the north-central  gulf coast of the united states , particularly new orleans.   [ 192 ]    
 bush declared a state of emergency in  louisiana  on august 27,   [ 193 ]    and in  mississippi  and  alabama  the following day;   [ 194 ]    he authorized the  department of homeland security  (dhs) and  federal emergency management agency  (fema) to manage the disaster, but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action.   [ 195 ]    the eye of the hurricane made landfall on august 29, and new orleans began to flood due to  levee  breaches; later that day, bush declared that a major disaster existed in louisiana,   [ 196 ]    officially authorizing fema to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort.

 on august 30, dhs secretary  michael chertoff  declared it "an incident of national significance",   [ 197 ]    triggering the first use of the newly created  national response plan . three days later, on september 2, national guard troops first entered the city of new orleans.   [ 198 ]    the same day, bush toured parts of louisiana,  mississippi , and  alabama  and declared that the success of the recovery effort up to that point was "not enough".   [ 199 ]    
 as the disaster in new orleans intensified, critics charged that bush was misrepresenting his administration's role in what they saw as a flawed response. leaders attacked bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at fema, notably  michael d. brown ;   [ 200 ]    it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result of the  iraq war    [ 201 ]    and bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods.   [ 202 ]      [ 203 ]      [ 204 ]    bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency.   [ 198 ]    it has been argued that with katrina, bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.   [ 205 ]

president bush announcing his nomination of alberto gonzales as the next u.s. attorney general, november 10, 2004 
 
 
 during bush's second term, a controversy arose over the  justice department's  midterm dismissal of seven  united states attorneys .   [ 206 ]    the white house maintained that the u.s. attorneys were fired for poor performance.   [ 207 ]    attorney general  alberto gonzales  later resigned over the issue, along with other senior members of the justice department.   [ 208 ]      [ 209 ]    the  house judiciary committee  issued subpoenas for advisers  harriet miers  and  josh bolten  to testify regarding this matter, but bush directed miers and bolten to not comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of  executive privilege . bush maintained that all of his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice. the justice department determined that the president's order was legal.   [ 210 ]    
 although congressional investigations focused on whether the justice department and the white house were using the u.s. attorney positions for political advantage, no official findings have been released. on march 10, 2008, the congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas.   [ 211 ]    on july 31, 2008, a  united states district court  judge ruled that bush's top advisers were not immune from congressional subpoenas.   [ 212 ]    
 in all, twelve justice department officials resigned rather than testify under oath before congress. they included attorney general  alberto gonzales    [ 213 ]    and his chief of staff  kyle sampson ,   [ 214 ]    gonzales' liaison to the white house  monica goodling ,   [ 215 ]    aide to the president  karl rove    [ 216 ]    and his senior aide  sara m. taylor .   [ 217 ]    in addition, legal counsel to the president  harriet miers    [ 218 ]    and deputy chief of staff to the president  joshua bolten    [ 219 ]    were both found in  contempt of congress .   [ 217 ]    
 in 2010, the justice department investigator concluded that though political considerations did play a part in as many as four of the attorney firings,   [ 220 ]    the firings were "inappropriately political", but not criminal. according to the prosecutors, there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution for any criminal offense.

 in july 2001, bush visited  pope john paul ii  at castel gandolfo.   [ 222 ]    
 during his presidential campaign, bush's  foreign policy  platform included support for stronger economic and political relationship with  latin america , especially  mexico , and a reduction of involvement in " nation-building " and other small-scale military engagements. the administration pursued a  national missile defense .   [ 223 ]    bush was an advocate of china's entry into the  world trade organization .   [ 224 ]    
 in his 2002 state of the union address, bush referred to an  axis of evil  including  iraq ,  iran  and  north korea .   [ 225 ]    after the september 11 attacks on new york, bush launched the war on terror, in which the united states military and a small international coalition  invaded afghanistan . in 2003, bush then launched the  invasion of iraq , searching for weapons of mass destruction, which he described as being part of the war on terrorism.   [ 226 ]    those invasions led to the toppling of the  taliban  regime in afghanistan and the removal of  saddam hussein  from power in iraq.

 bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with european nations. he appointed long-time adviser  karen hughes  to oversee a global public relations campaign. bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in georgia and ukraine. [   citation needed   ]  
 in march 2006, a visit to india led to renewed ties between the two countries, reversing decades of u.s. policy.   [ 227 ]    the visit focused particularly on areas of  nuclear energy  and counter-terrorism cooperation, discussions that would lead eventually to the  u.s.-india civil nuclear agreement .   [ 228 ]    
 this is in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor, clinton, whose approach and response to india after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring. the relationship between india and the united states was one that dramatically improved during bush's tenure.

 in a september 20 speech, bush condemned  osama bin laden  and his organization  al-qaeda , and issued an ultimatum to the taliban regime in afghanistan, where bin laden was operating, to "hand over the terrorists, or ... share in their fate".   [ 233 ]

 after september 11, bush announced a global war on terror. the afghan taliban regime was not forthcoming with osama bin laden, so bush ordered the  invasion of afghanistan  to overthrow the taliban regime.   [ 234 ]    in his january 29,  2002 state of the union address , he asserted that an " axis of evil " consisting of north korea, iran, and iraq was "arming to threaten the peace of the world" and "pose[d] a grave and growing danger".   [ 235 ]    the bush administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage  preemptive war , or  preventive war .   [ 236 ]    this became the basis for the  bush doctrine  which weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the united states which had followed the september 11 attacks.   [ 237 ]    
 dissent and criticism of bush's leadership in the war on terror increased as the war in iraq continued.   [ 238 ]      [ 239 ]      [ 240 ]    in 2006, a  national intelligence estimate  concluded that the iraq war had become the " cause célèbre  for  jihadists ".   [ 241 ]      [ 242 ]

president bush and president  hamid karzai  of afghanistan appearing at a joint news conference in kabul, march 1, 2006 
 
 
 on october 7, 2001, u.s. and british forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of  northern alliance  troops in  kabul  on november 13. the main goals of the war were to defeat the  taliban , drive  al-qaeda  out of afghanistan, and capture key al-qaeda leaders. in december 2001, the pentagon reported that the taliban had been defeated,   [ 243 ]    but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening taliban and al-qaeda leaders.   [ 243 ]    later that month the un had installed the  afghan transitional administration  chaired by  hamid karzai .   [ 244 ]      [ 245 ]    in 2002, based on  unicef  figures,  nicholas kristof  reported that "our invasion of afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade" as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aid.   [ 246 ]    
 efforts to kill or capture al-qaeda leader osama bin laden failed as he escaped a battle in december 2001 in the mountainous region of  tora bora , which the bush administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough u.s. ground troops.   [ 247 ]    it was not until may 2011, two years after bush left office, that bin laden was killed by u.s. forces. bin laden's successor,  ayman al-zawahiri , as well as the leader of the taliban,  mohammed omar , remain at large. 
 despite the initial success in driving the taliban from power in kabul, by early 2003 the taliban was regrouping, amassing new funds and recruits.   [ 248 ]    the 2005 failure of  operation red wings  showed that the taliban had returned.   [ 249 ]    in 2006, the  taliban insurgency  appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as  operation mountain thrust  attaining limited success.   [ 250 ]      [ 251 ]      [ 252 ]    as a result, bush commissioned 3,500 additional troops to the country in march 2007.   [ 253 ]

president bush, with  naval flight officer  lieutenant ryan philips, after landing on the uss  abraham lincoln  prior to his  mission accomplished speech , may 1, 2003 
 
 
 beginning with his january 29, 2002  state of the union address , bush began publicly focusing attention on iraq, which he labeled as part of an " axis of evil " allied with terrorists and posing "a grave and growing danger" to u.s. interests through possession of  weapons of mass destruction .   [ 235 ]      [ 254 ]    
 in the latter half of 2002, cia  reports  contained assertions of  saddam hussein 's intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs, not properly accounting for iraqi  biological  and  chemical weapons , and that some iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the un sanctions.   [ 255 ]      [ 256 ]    contentions that the bush administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.   [ 257 ]      [ 258 ]    
 in late 2002 and early 2003, bush urged the united nations to enforce iraqi  disarmament  mandates, precipitating a  diplomatic crisis . in november 2002, hans blix and  mohamed elbaradei  led un weapons inspectors in iraq, but were advised by the u.s. to depart the country four days prior to the u.s. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks.   [ 259 ]    the u.s. initially sought a  un security council  resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for un approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries.

 more than 20 nations (most notably the united kingdom), designated the " coalition of the willing " joined the united states   [ 261 ]    in invading iraq. they launched the invasion on march 20, 2003. the iraqi military was quickly defeated. the capital,  baghdad , fell on april 9, 2003. on may 1, bush declared the end of major combat operations in iraq. the initial success of u.s. operations increased his popularity, but the u.s. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; bush's " mission accomplished " speech was later criticized as premature.   [ 262 ]    from 2004 until 2007, the situation in iraq deteriorated further, with some observers arguing that there was a full-scale  civil war in iraq .   [ 263 ]    bush's policies met with criticism, including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from iraq. the 2006 report of the bipartisan  iraq study group , led by  james baker , concluded that the situation in iraq was "grave and deteriorating". while bush admitted that there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of iraq,   [ 264 ]    he maintained he would not change the overall iraq strategy.

 in january 2005, free, democratic elections were held in iraq for the first time in 50 years.   [ 267 ]    according to iraqi national security advisor  mowaffak al-rubaie , "this is the greatest day in the history of this country."   [ 267 ]    bush praised the event as well, saying that the iraqis "have taken rightful control of their country's destiny".   [ 267 ]    this led to the election of  jalal talabani  as president and  nouri al-maliki  as prime minister of iraq. a referendum to approve a constitution in iraq was held in october 2005, supported by most  shiites  and many  kurds .   [ 268 ]    
 on january 10, 2007, bush announced a  surge of 21,500 more troops for iraq , as well as a job program for iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and $1.2 billion for these programs.   [ 269 ]    on may 1, 2007, bush used his second-ever veto to reject a bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of u.s. troops,   [ 270 ]    saying the debate over the conflict was "understandable" but insisting that a continued u.s. presence there was crucial.   [ 271 ]    
 in march 2008, bush praised the iraqi government's "bold decision" to launch the  battle of basra  against the  mahdi army , calling it "a defining moment in the history of a free iraq".   [ 272 ]    he said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding general  david petraeus  and ambassador  ryan crocker  about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of 2008. he also praised the iraqis' legislative achievements, including a pension law, a revised de-baathification law, a new budget, an amnesty law, and a provincial powers measure that, he said, set the stage for the  iraqi elections .   [ 273 ]    by july 2008, american troop deaths had reached their lowest number since the war began,   [ 274 ]    and due to increased stability in iraq, bush announced the withdrawal of additional american forces.   [ 274 ]    
  surveillance  
 following the events of september 11, bush issued an executive order authorizing the  president's surveillance program  which included allowing the  nsa  to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the u.s and parties within the u.s. without obtaining a warrant as required by the  foreign intelligence surveillance act .   [ 275 ]    as of 2009, the other provisions of the program remained highly classified.   [ 276 ]    once the  department of justice   office of legal counsel  questioned its original legal opinion that fisa did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the president on the basis that the warrant requirements of fisa were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the  authorization for use of military force against terrorists .   [ 277 ]    the program proved to be  controversial , as critics of the administration, as well as organizations such as the  american bar association , argued that it was illegal.   [ 278 ]    in august 2006, a u.s. district court judge ruled that the  nsa electronic surveillance program  was unconstitutional,   [ 279 ]    but on july 6, 2007, that ruling was  vacated  by the  united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit  on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked  standing .   [ 280 ]    on january 17, 2007, attorney general alberto gonzales informed u.s. senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the president, but would be subjected to judicial oversight.   [ 281 ]    later in 2007, the nsa launched a replacement for the program, referred to as  prism , that was subject to the oversight of the  united states foreign intelligence surveillance court .   [ 282 ]    this program was not publicly revealed until reports by the   washington post     [ 282 ]    and   the guardian     [ 283 ]    emerged in june 2013.   [ 282 ]

 bush authorized the  cia  to use  waterboarding  as one of several  enhanced interrogation techniques .   [ 284 ]      [ 285 ]      [ 286 ]    between 2002 and 2003 the cia considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, to be legal based on a secret justice department legal opinion arguing that terror detainees were not protected by the  geneva conventions ' ban on torture and vice president cheney said enhanced interrogation including waterboarding was not torture or illegal.   [ 287 ]      [ 288 ]    the cia had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given to it in the  bybee memo  from the attorney general, though that memo was later withdrawn.   [ 289 ]    while not permitted by the  u.s. army field manuals  which assert "that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information",   [ 287 ]    the bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations "provided critical information" to preserve american lives.   [ 290 ]    critics, such as former cia officer bob baer, have stated that information was suspect, "you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture's bad enough."   [ 291 ]    
 on october 17, 2006, bush signed into law the  military commissions act of 2006 ,   [ 292 ]    a law enacted in the wake of the  supreme court's  decision in   hamdan v. rumsfeld  , 548  u.s.   557  (2006),   [ 293 ]    which allows the u.s. government to prosecute  unlawful enemy combatants  by military commission rather than a standard trial. the law also denies them access to   habeas corpus   and bars the torture of detainees, but allows the president to determine what constitutes torture.   [ 292 ]    
 on march 8, 2008, bush vetoed h.r. 2082,   [ 294 ]    a bill that would have expanded congressional oversight over the intelligence community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of interrogation not permitted under the  united states army field manual on human intelligence collector operations , saying that "the bill congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the war on terror".   [ 295 ]    in april 2009, the aclu sued and won release of the secret memos that had authorized the bush administration's interrogation tactics.   [ 296 ]    one memo detailed specific interrogation tactics including a footnote that described waterboarding as torture as well as that the form of waterboarding used by the cia was far more intense than authorized by the justice department.

 bush publicly condemned  kim jong-il  of north korea, naming north korea one of three states in an " axis of evil ", and saying that "the united states of america will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons."   [ 235 ]    within months, "both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the u.s.-dprk  agreed framework of october 1994 ."   [ 298 ]    north korea's october 9, 2006,  detonation  of a nuclear device further complicated bush's foreign policy, which centered for both terms of his presidency on "[preventing] the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the united states and the world".   [ 235 ]    bush condemned north korea's position, reaffirmed his commitment to "a nuclear-free korean peninsula", and stated that "transfer of nuclear weapons or material by north korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the united states", for which north korea would be held accountable.   [ 299 ]    on may 7, 2007, north korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account. this was a result of a series of three-way talks initiated by the united states and including china.   [ 300 ]    on september 2, 2007, north korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all of its nuclear programs by the end of 2007.   [ 301 ]    by may 2009, north korea had restarted its nuclear program and threatened to attack south korea.   [ 302 ]    
 on june 22, 2010, "while south korea prospers, the people of north korea have suffered profoundly," he said, adding that, "communism had resulted in dire poverty, mass starvation and brutal suppression. "in recent years," he went on to say, "the suffering has been compounded by the leader who wasted north korea's precious few resources on personal luxuries and nuclear weapons programs."

[ 304 ]    in early 2007, the  treasury department , acting on a june 2005  executive order , froze american bank accounts of syria's higher institute of applied science and technology, electronics institute, and national standards and calibration laboratory. bush's order prohibits americans from doing business with these institutions suspected of helping spread  weapons of mass destruction    [ 305 ]    and being supportive of terrorism.   [ 306 ]    under separate executive orders signed by bush in 2004 and later 2007, the treasury department froze the assets of two lebanese and two syrians, accusing them of activities to "undermine the legitimate political process in lebanon" in november 2007. those designated included: assaad halim hardan, a member of lebanon's parliament and current leader of the syrian socialist national party; wi'am wahhab, a former member of lebanon's government (minister of the environment) under prime minister omar karami (2004–2005); hafiz makhluf, a colonel and senior official in the syrian general intelligence directorate and a cousin of syrian president  bashar al-assad ; and muhammad nasif khayrbik, identified as a close adviser to assad.

[ 328 ]      [ 329 ]    "i think people look at him and think  john wayne ," said  piers morgan , editor of the british   daily mirror  .   [ 330 ]    it has been suggested that bush's accent was an active choice, as a way of distinguishing himself from northeastern intellectuals and anchoring himself to his texas roots.   [ 331 ]    both supporters and detractors have pointed to his country persona as reasons for their support or criticism.   [ 329 ]    
 bush has been  parodied  by the media,   [ 332 ]    comedians, and other politicians.   [ 333 ]      [ 334 ]    detractors tended to cite linguistic errors made by bush during his public speeches, which are colloquially referred to as  bushisms .   [ 335 ]    some pundits labeled bush "the worst president ever".   [ 336 ]      [ 337 ]      [ 338 ]      [ 339 ]      [ 340 ]    in contrast to his father, who was perceived as having troubles with an overarching unifying theme, bush embraced larger visions and was seen as a man of larger ideas and associated huge risks.   [ 341 ]    tony blair wrote in 2010 that the caricature of bush as being dumb is "ludicrous" and that bush is "very smart".   [ 342 ]    in an interview with   playboy  ,  new york times  columnist david brooks said george w. bush "was 60 iq points smarter in private than he was in public. he doesn't want anybody to think he's smarter than they are, so puts on a texas act."   [ 343 ]    
  job approval  
 bush began his presidency with  approval ratings  near 50 percent.   [ 344 ]    after the  september 11 attacks , bush gained an approval rating of 90 percent,   [ 345 ]    maintaining 80 to 90 percent approval for four months after the attacks. it remained over 50 percent during most of his first term   [ 15 ]    and then fell to as low as 19 percent in his second term.   [ 346 ]    
 in 2000 and again in 2004,   time   magazine named george w. bush as its  person of the year , a title awarded to someone who the editors believe "has done the most to influence the events of the year".   [ 347 ]    in may 2004,  gallup  reported that 89 percent of the republican electorate approved of bush.   [ 348 ]    however, the support waned due mostly to a minority of republicans' frustration with him on issues of spending, illegal immigration, and  middle eastern  affairs.   [ 349 ]    
 within the united states armed forces, according to an unscientific survey, the president was strongly supported in the 2004 presidential elections.   [ 350 ]    while 73 percent of military personnel said that they would vote for bush, 18 percent preferred his democratic rival,  john kerry .   [ 350 ]    according to  peter d. feaver , a  duke university  political scientist who has studied the political leanings of the u.s. military, members of the armed services supported bush because they found him more likely than kerry to complete the war in iraq.   [ 350 ]    
 bush's approval rating went below the 50 percent mark in  ap - ipsos  polling in december 2004.   [ 351 ]    thereafter, his approval ratings and approval of his handling of domestic and foreign policy issues steadily dropped. bush received heavy criticism for his handling of the  iraq war , his  response to hurricane katrina  and to the  abu ghraib prisoner abuse ,  nsa warrantless surveillance , the  plame affair , and  guantanamo bay detention camp  controversies.   [ 352 ]    there were calls for bush's  impeachment , though most polls showed a plurality of americans would not support such an action.   [ 353 ]    the arguments offered for impeachment usually centered on the nsa warrantless surveillance controversy,   [ 354 ]    the bush administration's justification for the war in iraq,   [ 355 ]    and alleged violations of the  geneva conventions .   [ 356 ]     representative   dennis kucinich  (d- oh ), who had run against bush during the 2004 presidential campaign, introduced 35 articles of impeachment on the floor of the house of representatives against bush on june 9, 2008, but  speaker   nancy pelosi  (d- ca ) declared that impeachment was "off the table".   [ 357 ]    
 polls conducted in 2006 showed an average of 37 percent approval ratings for bush,   [ 358 ]    the lowest for any second-term president at that point of his term since  harry s. truman  in march 1951 (when truman's approval rating was 28 percent),   [ 351 ]      [ 359 ]    which contributed to what bush called the "thumping" of the republican party in the  2006 mid-term elections .   [ 360 ]    throughout most of 2007, bush's approval rating hovered in the mid-thirties;   [ 361 ]    the average for his entire second term was 37 percent, according to gallup.   [ 362 ]    
 
    
 
    
president bush's approval rating with key events marked, 2001–2006 
 
 
 by the beginning of 2008, his final year in office, bush's approval rating had dropped to a low of just 19 percent, largely from the loss of support among republicans.   [ 346 ]    commenting on his low poll numbers and accusations of being "the worst president,"   [ 363 ]      [ 364 ]    bush would say, "i make decisions on what i think is right for the united states based upon principles. i frankly don't give a damn about the polls."   [ 365 ]    
 in the spring of that year, bush's disapproval ratings reached the highest ever recorded for any president in the 70-year history of the  gallup poll , with 69 percent of those polled in april 2008 disapproving of the job bush was doing as president and 28 percent approving—although the majority (66 percent) of republicans still approved of his job performance.   [ 366 ]    
 in polls conducted in the fall, just before the 2008 election, his approval ratings remained at record lows of 19 to 20 percent,   [ 367 ]      [ 368 ]    while his disapproval ratings ranged from 67 percent to as high as 75 percent.   [ 368 ]      [ 369 ]    in polling conducted january 9–11, 2009, his final job approval rating by gallup was 34 percent, which placed him on par with  jimmy carter  and  harry truman , the other presidents whose final gallup ratings measured in the low 30's ( richard nixon 's final gallup approval rating was even lower, at 24 percent).   [ 370 ]    according to a  cbs news / new york times  poll conducted january 11–15, 2009, bush's final approval rating in office was 22 percent.   [ 367 ]    
 early in his presidency, following the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, he had achieved the highest job approval rating of any american president since world war ii, at 90 percent;   [ 366 ]      [ 367 ]    but bush left the white house as one of the most unpopular presidents, second in overall unpopularity only to richard nixon.

  foreign perceptions

 bush was criticized internationally and targeted by the global anti-war and anti-globalization campaigns for his administration's foreign policy.   [ 372 ]      [ 373 ]    views of him within the  international community  were more negative than those of most previous american presidents, even from close ally france.   [ 374 ]    
 bush was described as having especially close personal relationships with tony blair of the uk and  vicente fox  of mexico, although formal relations were sometimes strained.   [ 375 ]      [ 376 ]      [ 377 ]    other leaders, such as afghan president  hamid karzai ,   [ 378 ]    ugandan president  yoweri museveni ,   [ 379 ]    spanish prime minister  josé luis rodríguez zapatero ,   [ 380 ]    and venezuelan president  hugo chávez ,   [ 381 ]    openly criticized the president. later in bush's presidency, tensions arose between him and  vladimir putin , which led to a cooling of their relationship.   [ 382 ]

 in 2006, most respondents in 18 of 21 countries surveyed around the world were found to hold an unfavorable opinion of bush. respondents indicated that they judged his administration as negative for world security.   [ 383 ]      [ 384 ]    in 2007, the  pew global attitudes project  reported that during the bush presidency, attitudes towards the united states, and towards americans, became less favorable around the world.   [ 385 ]    
 a march 2007 survey of arab opinion conducted by zogby international and the  university of maryland  found that bush was the most disliked leader in the arab world.   [ 386 ]    
 the  pew research center 's 2007 global attitudes poll found that out of 47 countries, in only nine countries did most respondents express "a lot of confidence" or "some confidence" in bush: ethiopia, ghana, india, israel, ivory coast, kenya, mali, nigeria, and uganda.   [ 387 ]    
 during a june 2007 visit to the predominantly muslim   [ 388 ]     albania , bush was greeted enthusiastically. albania has a population of 2.8 million,   [ 389 ]    has troops in both iraq and afghanistan, and the country's government is highly supportive of american foreign policy.   [ 390 ]    a huge image of the president was hung in the middle of the capital city of  tirana  flanked by albanian and american flags while a local street was named after him.   [ 391 ]      [ 392 ]    a shirt-sleeved statue of bush was unveiled in  fushe-kruje , a few kilometers northwest of  tirana .   [ 393 ]    the bush administration's support for the independence of albanian-majority kosovo, while endearing him to the  albanians , has troubled u.s. relations with serbia, leading to the february 2008 torching of the u.s. embassy in  belgrade .   [ 394 ]    
  acknowledgments and dedications  
 on may 7, 2005, during an official state visit to latvia, bush was awarded the  order of the three stars  presented to him by president  vaira v??e-freiberga .   [ 395 ]    a few places outside the united states bear bush's name. in 2005, the  tbilisi  city council voted to rename a street in honor of the u.s. president.   [ 396 ]    previously known as melaani drive, the street links the  georgian  capital's airport with the city center and was used by bush's motorcade during his visit four months earlier.   [ 397 ]    a street in  tirana , formerly known as  rruga puntorët e rilendjes , situated directly outside the  albanian parliament , was renamed after bush a few days before he made the first-ever visit by an american president to albania in june 2007.   [ 398 ]    in  jerusalem , a small plaza with a monument bearing his name is also dedicated to bush.   [ 399 ]    
 in 2012, estonian president  toomas hendrik ilves  awarded bush the  order of the cross of terra mariana  for his work in expanding nato.   [ 400 ]

 following the  inauguration of barack obama , bush and his family flew from  andrews air force base  to a homecoming celebration in  midland, texas , following which they returned to their ranch in  crawford, texas .   [ 401 ]    they bought a home in the  preston hollow  neighborhood of  dallas , texas, where they settled down.   [ 402 ]    
 he makes regular appearances at various events throughout the dallas/fort worth area, most notably when he conducted the opening coin toss at the  dallas cowboys  first game in the team's new  stadium  in  arlington    [ 403 ]    and an april 2009 visit to a  texas rangers  game, where he thanked the people of dallas for helping him settle in and was met with a standing ovation.   [ 404 ]    he also attended every home playoff game for the  texas rangers  2010 season and, accompanied by his father, threw out the ceremonial first pitch at  rangers ballpark in arlington  for game 4 of the  2010 world series  on october 31, 2010.   [ 405 ]    
 on august 6, 2013, bush was successfully treated for a  coronary artery blockage  with a  stent . the blockage had been found during an  annual medical examination .   [ 406 ]

george w. bush, president obama, and bill clinton meeting in the oval office, january 16, 2010 
 
 
 since leaving office, bush has kept a relatively low profile   [ 407 ]    though he has made public appearances, most notably after the release of his memoirs in 2010 and for the 10th anniversary of the  september 11 attacks  in 2011. in march 2009, he delivered his first post-presidency speech in  calgary , alberta,   [ 408 ]      [ 409 ]    appeared via video on   the colbert report   during which he praised u.s. troops for earning a "special place in american history,"   [ 410 ]    and attended the funeral of senator  ted kennedy .   [ 411 ]    bush made his debut as a motivational speaker on october 26 at the "get motivated" seminar in dallas.   [ 412 ]    in the aftermath of the  fort hood shooting  that took place on november 5, 2009, in texas, the bushes paid an undisclosed visit to the survivors and victims' families the day following the shooting, having contacted the base commander requesting that the visit be private and not involve press coverage.   [ 413 ]    
 bush released his memoirs,   decision points  , on november 9, 2010. during a pre-release appearance promoting the book, bush said he considered his biggest accomplishment to be keeping "the country safe amid a real danger", and his greatest failure to be his inability to secure the passage of  social security reform .   [ 414 ]    he also made news defending his administration's enhanced interrogation techniques, specifically the  waterboarding  of  khalid sheikh mohammed , saying, "i'd do it again to save lives."   [ 415 ]    
 in 2012, he wrote the foreword of   the 4% solution: unleashing the economic growth america needs  , an economics book published by the  george w. bush presidential center .   [ 416 ]      [ 417 ]      [ 418 ]    he also presented the book at the  parkland memorial hospital  in dallas, texas.   [ 419 ]    
 bush appeared on  nbc 's   the tonight show with jay leno   on november 19, 2013, along with the former  first lady . when asked by leno why he does not comment publicly about the  obama administration , bush said, "i don't think it's good for the country to have a former president criticize his successor."   [ 420 ]    despite this statement, on saturday, april 25, 2015, bush criticized president  barack obama  at a meeting of the  republican jewish coalition  at the  venetian hotel  in las vegas. bush criticized obama's handling of iran, specifically with respect to sanctions and a nuclear deal, saying: "you think the middle east is chaotic now? imagine what it looks like for our grandchildren. that’s how americans should view the deal." bush also attacked obama's withdrawal of u.s. troops from iraq in 2011, calling it a "strategic blunder", borrowing a term that had been used by south carolina senator  lindsey graham .   [ 421 ]    
 alongside the 2014  united states–africa leaders summit , bush,  michelle obama , the state department, and the  george w. bush institute  hosted a daylong forum on education and health with the spouses of the african leaders attending the summit. bush urged african leaders to avoid discriminatory laws that make the treatment of  hiv/aids  more difficult.   [ 422 ]    
 bush has spoken in favor of increased global participation of women in politics and societal matters in foreign countries.   [ 423 ]      [ 424 ]    
 on november 2, 2014, bush spoke at an event to 200 business and civic leaders at the george w. bush presidential library and museum to raise awareness for the upcoming  museum of the bible  in washington d.c.   [ 51 ]      [ 425 ]    
 bush published a  biography  of his father,  george h.w. bush , called   41: a portrait of my father  . it was released on november 11, 2014.   [ 426 ]    
 in an interview published by  israel hayom  magazine on june 12, 2015, bush said that he thought you would "need boots on the ground" in order to defeat the  islamic state in iraq and the levant  (isis). he added that people had said during his presidency that he should get out of iraq, but he chose the opposite, sending 30,000 more troups in order to defeat  al qaeda in iraq , and al qaeda in iraq was defeated. bush was also asked about iran but declined to answer, stating that any answer he gives would be interpreted as undermining president  barack obama .   [ 427 ]    
  collaborations  
 at president obama's request, bush and bill clinton established the  clinton bush haiti fund  to raise contributions for relief and recovery efforts following the  2010 haiti earthquake  earlier in january.   [ 428 ]    
 on may 2, 2011, president obama called bush, who was at a restaurant with his wife, to inform him that  osama bin laden had been killed .   [ 429 ]    the bushes joined the obamas in new york city to mark the tenth anniversary of the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. at the ground zero memorial, bush read  a letter  that president  abraham lincoln  wrote to a widow who lost five sons during the civil war.   [ 430 ]    
  visual art  
 after serving as president, bush began  painting  as a  hobby . subjects have included dogs and  still life .   [ 431 ]    he has also painted self-portraits and portraits of world leaders, including vladimir putin and tony blair.   [ 432 ]      [ 433 ]      [ 434 ]    
 his paintings have been met with a middling reception by art critics. bill arning, director of the  contemporary arts museum houston , called his portraits "thickly painted in what i would call 'high-amateur' mode" and wrote, "i would say they need to be less based on photographic reproduction. you can tell when someone is taking a found photograph and making a painting out of it [...] i think he'd be well advised to work from other, multiple photographic sources or the real person to get a little bit more liveliness going on."   [ 435 ]    
  legacy  
 george w. bush's legacy remains a contested one, with both liberals and conservatives holding strong views on his overall place in history. supporters credit bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from occurring after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the  no child left behind act , the  medicare  prescription drug benefit and the aids relief program known as  pepfar . critics often point to his handling of the  iraq war  - specifically the failure to find  weapons of mass destruction  that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion — as well as his handling of  tax policy ,  hurricane katrina  and the  2008 financial crisis  as proof that george w. bush was unfit to be president.   [ 436 ]      [ 437 ]    the no child left behind act has also become an area of criticism in recent years, as many academics [   who?   ]  have argued that states' increasing reliance on  standardized testing  which resulted from the legislation has worsened american education. [   citation needed   ]  
 despite the ongoing debate between liberals and conservatives, several historians and commentators hold the view that bush was one of the most consequential presidents in american history.  princeton university  scholar julian zelizer described bush's presidency as a "transformative" one, and said that "some people hate him, some people love him, but i do think he'll have a much more substantive perception as time goes on".   [ 438 ]    bryon williams of   the huffington post   referred to bush as "the most noteworthy president since  fdr " and said that the  patriot act  "increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable" as evidence.   [ 439 ]    bush's administration presided over the largest tax cuts since the  reagan administration ,   [ 440 ]    and his homeland security reforms proved to be the most significant expansion of the federal government since the  great society .   [ 441 ]    much of these policies has endured in the administration of bush's  democratic  successor,  barack obama .   [ 442 ]      [ 443 ]    
 among the public, his reputation has improved somewhat since his presidency ended in 2009. in february 2012, gallup reported that "americans still rate george w. bush among the worst presidents, though their views have become more positive in the three years since he left office."   [ 444 ]    gallup had earlier noted that bush's favorability ratings in public opinion surveys had begun to rise a year after he had left office, from 40 percent in january 2009 and 35 percent in march 2009, to 45 percent in july 2010, a period during which he had remained largely out of the news.   [ 445 ]    other pollsters have noted similar trends of slight improvement in bush's personal favorability since the end of his presidency.   [ 446 ]    in april 2013, bush's approval rating stood at 47 percent approval and 50 percent disapproval in a poll jointly conducted for the   washington post   and  abc , his highest approval rating since december 2005. bush had achieved notable gains among seniors, non-college whites, and moderate and conservative democrats since leaving office, although majorities disapproved of his handling of the economy (53 percent) and the iraq war (57 percent).   [ 447 ]    his 47 percent approval rating was equal to that of president obama's in the same polling period.   [ 448 ]    a  cnn  poll conducted that same month found that 55 percent of americans said bush's presidency had been a failure, with 80 percent of republican calling it a success, but only 43 percent of independents calling it a success and nearly 90 percent of democrats calling it a failure.   [ 449 ]    
 while president bush's approval rating among the public has seen an improvement, the most recent survey of the opinions of historians, political scientists, and presidential scholars, conducted in 2010 by the  siena research institute , ranked him 39th out of 43 presidents. the survey respondents gave president bush low ratings on his handling of the u.s. economy, communication, ability to compromise, foreign policy accomplishments, and intelligence.
