  millard fillmore  (january 7, 1800 – march 8, 1874) was the  13th   president of the united states  (1850–1853), the last  whig  president, and the last president not to be affiliated with either the  democratic  or  republican  parties. fillmore was the only whig president who did not die in office or get expelled from the party, and fillmore appointed the only whig  supreme court   justice . as  zachary taylor 's vice president, he assumed the presidency after taylor's death. fillmore was a lawyer from western new york state, and an early member of the whig party. he served in the state legislature (1829–1831), as a  u.s. representative  (1833–1835, 1837–1843), and as  new york state comptroller  (1848–1849). he was elected  vice president of the united states  in 1848 as taylor's running mate, and served from 1849 until taylor's death in 1850, at the height of the "crisis of 1850" over  slavery . 
 as an anti-slavery moderate, he opposed  abolitionist  demands to exclude slavery from all  the territory gained in the mexican war . instead he supported the  compromise of 1850 , which briefly ended the crisis. in foreign policy, fillmore supported  u.s. navy expeditions to open trade in japan , opposed  french  designs on hawaii, and was embarrassed by  narciso lópez's filibuster expeditions  to  cuba . he sought election to a full term in 1852, but was passed over for the nomination by the whigs. 
 when the whig party broke up in 1854–1856, fillmore and other conservative whigs joined the american party, the political arm of the anti-immigrant, anti-catholic " know-nothing " movement, though he himself was not anti-catholic. he was the american party candidate for president in 1856, but finished third. during the  american civil war , fillmore denounced secession and agreed that the union must be maintained by force if necessary, but was very critical of the war policies of president  abraham lincoln . after the war, he supported the  reconstruction  policies of president  andrew johnson . although some have praised fillmore's restrained foreign policy, he is criticized for having further aggravated tensions between abolitionists and slaveholders, he is placed near the bottom 10 of  historical rankings of presidents of the united states  by various scholarly surveys. 
 fillmore founded the  university at buffalo  and was the university's first chancellor.   [ 2 ]    he also helped found the  buffalo historical society  and the  buffalo general hospital .

  early life and career  
 fillmore was born in a  log cabin    [ 3 ]    in  moravia ,  cayuga county , in the  finger lakes  region of  new york state , on january 7, 1800. his parents were  nathaniel fillmore  and phoebe millard. he was the second of nine children and the eldest son.   [ 4 ]    he later lived in  east aurora , new york in the  southtowns  region south of  buffalo .   [ 5 ]      [ 6 ]    though fillmore's ancestors were scottish  presbyterians  on his father's side and english dissenters on his mother's, he became a  unitarian  in later life.   [ 7 ]    his father  apprenticed  him to cloth maker benjamin hungerford in  sparta , new york,   [ 8 ]    at age fourteen to learn the cloth-making trade. he left after four months, but subsequently took another apprenticeship in the same trade at  new hope , new york. he struggled to obtain an education living on the frontier and attended new hope academy for six months in 1819. there he fell in love with his future wife  abigail powers .   [ 9 ]    later that year, he began to clerk and study law under judge walter wood of montville. 
 fillmore bought out his cloth-making apprenticeship, left judge wood, and moved to buffalo, where he continued his studies in the law office of asa rice and joseph clary. he was  admitted to the bar  in 1823 and began his law practice in east aurora, new york. in 1825, he built a house there for himself and abigail. they were married on february 5, 1826. they had two children,  millard powers fillmore  and  mary abigail fillmore . 
 in 1834, he formed a law partnership, fillmore and hall (which became fillmore, hall and haven in 1836), with close friend  nathan k. hall  who would later serve in his cabinet as  postmaster general .   [ 10 ]    it would become one of western new york's most prestigious firms,   [ 11 ]    and exists to this day as hodgson russ llp. 
 fillmore was a member of the  new york militia  in the 1820s and 1830s, and served as inspector of new york's 47th brigade with the rank of  major .   [ 12 ]      [ 13 ]    
 in 1846, he helped found the private university of buffalo, which today is the public  university at buffalo , the largest school in the new york state university system. 
  politics  
 
    
 
    
millard fillmore helped build  this house  in  east aurora, new york , and lived here 1826–1830. 
 
 
 in 1828, fillmore was elected to the  new york state assembly  on the  anti-masonic  ticket, serving three one-year terms, from 1829 to 1831. in his final term he chaired a special legislative committee to enact a new bankruptcy law that eliminated debtors' prison. as the measure had support among some democrats, he maneuvered the law into place by taking a nonpartisan approach and allowing the democrats to take credit for the bill. this kind of inconspicuousness and avoiding the limelight would later characterize fillmore's approach to politics on the national stage. 
 he was a follower and associate of  thurlow weed , who had been a leading anti-mason. when weed left the anti-masons in 1832, fillmore did too; when weed became the leading whig organizer in new york, fillmore also joined the whigs. in 1832, he was elected  u.s. representative  from  new york's 32nd congressional district  a "national republican", serving in the  23rd congress  from 1833 to 1835. he was succeeded in 1834 by "anti-jacksonian" thomas c. love. love declined renomination in 1836, and fillmore was elected as a  whig  (having followed his mentor  thurlow weed  into the party). he was re-elected twice, serving from 1837 to 1843, in the  25th ,  26th , and  27th congresses . he declined re-nomination in 1842. 
 in congress, he opposed admitting texas as a  slave territory , he advocated  internal improvements  and a  protective tariff , he supported  john quincy adams  by voting to receive anti-slavery petitions, he advocated the prohibition by congress of the slave trade between the states, and he favored the exclusion of slavery from the  district of columbia .   [ 14 ]      [ 15 ]    he came in second place in the vote for  speaker of the house  in 1841. he served as chair of the  house ways and means committee  from 1841 to 1843 and was an author of the  tariff of 1842 , as well as two other bills that president  john tyler  vetoed. 
 after leaving congress, fillmore was the unsuccessful whig party candidate for governor of new york in the  1844 election . he was the first  new york state comptroller  elected by general ballot, defeating  orville hungerford  174,756 to 136,027 votes,   [ 16 ]    and was in office from 1848 to 1849. as comptroller, he revised new york's banking system, making it a model for the future national banking system. 
  vice presidency (1849–1850)  
 
    
 
    
fillmore in 1849 
 
 
 the  1848 whig national convention  nominated general  zachary taylor  (a slaveholder from  louisiana ) for president. this upset supporters of  henry clay  and " conscience whigs " opposed to slavery in  territories gained in the mexican–american war . a group of whig pragmatists sought to balance the ticket, and the convention nominated fillmore for vice president. fillmore came from a free state, had moderate anti-slavery views, and could help carry the populous state of new york.

 fillmore was also selected in part to prevent the nomination of the anti-slavery  william h. seward , and prevent seward from receiving a position in taylor's cabinet. (in an era where the president, vice president and cabinet were expected to reflect geographic balance, fillmore would "represent" new york, meaning another new yorker – seward – could not be in the cabinet.)   [ 17 ]      [ 18 ]      [ 19 ]    
 the taylor-fillmore ticket won, taking 1,361,393 votes (47.3%) and 163 electoral votes (16 states carried).  lewis cass  and  william orlando butler , the democrats, took 1,223,460 votes (42.5%) and 127 electoral votes (15 states carried). the third-party  free soil  candidates  martin van buren  and  charles francis adams, sr.  took only 291,501 votes (10.1%) and 0 electoral votes. 
 soon the nation was roiled by the "crisis of 1850". pro-slavery southerners demanded that all the new territories should be open to slavery. anti-slavery northerners demanded complete exclusion. the recently admitted state of texas claimed a large part of  new mexico , and wanted the u.s. to assume the "national debt" of the former  republic of texas . california settlers were petitioning for immediate admission as a free state, with no territorial stage. there were also disputes about slavery and the slave trade in the  district of columbia , about the apprehension of slaves who escaped to the free states, and about the territorial status of  utah , newly settled by the  mormons . 
 fillmore presided over the senate during the months of nerve-wracking debates over these issues. during one debate, enraged senator  thomas hart benton  of  missouri  stalked toward senator  henry s. foote  of  mississippi , who brandished a pistol at benton.   [ 20 ]    
 taylor stunned his fellow southerners by urging the immediate admission of california and new mexico as free states. ironically, it was fillmore, the northerner, who supported slavery in at least part of the territory to avoid an open break with the south. he wrote: "god knows that i detest slavery, but it is an existing evil ... and we must endure it and give it such protection as is guaranteed by the constitution." 
 clay constructed a compromise bill which included provisions desired by both sides. fillmore did not comment publicly on the merits of the compromise proposals. a few days before president taylor's death, fillmore suggested to the president that if the vote on clay's bill was tied, he as  president of the senate  would cast his tie-breaking vote in favor.

 taylor died suddenly on july 9, 1850, and fillmore became president. the change in leadership also signaled an abrupt political shift. taylor, it was thought, would have vetoed the compromise bill (though some historians now doubt this). when fillmore took office, the entire cabinet offered their resignations. fillmore accepted them all and appointed men who, except for treasury secretary  thomas corwin , favored the compromise of 1850.   [ 21 ]    when the compromise finally came before both houses of congress, it was very watered down. as a result, fillmore urged congress to pass the original bill. this move only provoked an enormous battle where "forces for and against slavery fought over every word of the bill."   [ 21 ]    to fillmore's disappointment the bitter battle over the bill crushed public support.   [ 21 ]    clay, exhausted, left washington to recuperate, passing leadership to senator  stephen a. douglas  of illinois. at this critical juncture, president fillmore announced his support of the compromise of 1850.   [ 21 ]    
 on august 6, 1850, he sent a message to congress recommending that texas's debts be paid provided texas abandoned its claims in new mexico. this, and his deployment of 750 federal troops to new mexico, helped shift a critical number of northern whigs in congress away from their insistence upon the  wilmot proviso , the stipulation that all the mexican lands must be closed to slavery. douglas modified clay's bill accordingly, and then split it into five separate senate bills. these bills were: admission of california as a free state (which happened on september 9, 1850); settlement of the texas boundary and debts; creation of  new mexico territory , which would be open to slavery; the  fugitive slave act ; and abolition of the slave trade (but not slavery), in the  district of columbia .

 each measure obtained a majority, and, by september 20, president fillmore had signed them into law.  daniel webster  wrote, "i can now sleep of nights." only a few extremists on both sides denounced the compromise. a slave-state convention called to discuss secession drew only a few delegates. northerners were happy with the admission of california. nonetheless, the compromise disrupted the whig party, which did badly in the fall 1850 elections in the north. northern whigs were heard to say "god save us from whig vice presidents." 
 fillmore's greatest difficulty was the fugitive slave law: southerners complained bitterly about any slackness, but enforcement was highly offensive to northerners. fillmore's solution was to enforce the fugitive slave law, but also enforce the neutrality act of 1818 against filibustering southerners who were trying to make  cuba  a slave state). 
 fillmore appointed  brigham young  as the first governor of the  utah territory  in 1850.   [ 22 ]    in gratitude for creating the utah territory in 1850 and appointing young as governor, young named the territorial capital " fillmore " and the surrounding county " millard ".   [ 23 ]    
 fillmore appointed  benjamin robbins curtis  to seat two of the  supreme court of the united states . curtis served from september 22, 1851,   [ 24 ]    to september 30, 1857. 
 he attempted four times to fill the vacancy caused by justice  john mckinley 's death. the senate took no action on the nomination of  new orleans  attorney  edward a. bradford .  george edmund badger  withdrew his nomination. senator  judah p. benjamin  declined to serve. the nomination of  william c. micou , another new orleans lawyer recommended by benjamin, was not acted on by the senate. the vacancy was finally filled after fillmore's term, when president pierce nominated  john archibald campbell , who was confirmed by the senate.   [ 25 ]    
 fillmore also appointed four other federal judges, all to  united states district courts .  john glenn  was appointed to the  united states district court for the district of maryland  and served from march 19, 1852 to july 8, 1853. 
  nathan k. hall  was appointed to the  united states district court for the northern district of new york  and served from august 31, 1852 to march 3, 1874. 
  ogden hoffman, jr.  was appointed to the  united states district court for the northern district of california  and the  united states district court for the southern district of california . he began serving on february 27, 1851. hoffman was reassigned several times, beginning on january 18, 1854, as the california federal courts were redistricted. he served until july 23, 1866.   [ 26 ]    
  james mchall jones  was appointed to the  united states district court for the southern district of california  and served from december 26, 1850 to december 15, 1851. 
  foreign affairs  
 in foreign affairs, fillmore was particularly active in the asia and the pacific, especially with regard to japan, which at this time still prohibited nearly all foreign contact. american merchants and shipowners wanted japan "opened up" for trade, and so that american ships could call there for food and water on voyages to asia, and could put in there in emergencies without being punished. they were also concerned that american sailors cast away on the japanese coast were imprisoned as criminals.   [ 27 ]    
 american merchants saw in the british opening of china to trade an example of the "benefits of new trade markets."   [ 27 ]    fillmore and secretary of state daniel webster dispatched  commodore   matthew c. perry  to open japan to relations with the outside world.   [ 27 ]    though perry did not reach japan until after the end of fillmore's term, fillmore ordered the  perry expedition , and its success is to his credit.   [ 27 ]    
 fillmore was also a staunch opponent of european meddling in hawaii. france under  napoleon iii  attempted to annex hawaii, but backed down after fillmore issued strongly worded message suggesting that "the united states would not stand for any such action."   [ 27 ]    
 though president taylor had signed the  clayton–bulwer treaty  preventing britain and the u.s. from acquiring new possessions in the americas, great britain and the united states were still attempting to gain ground in the region.   [ 27 ]    the situation became tense enough that fillmore ordered several warships to guard american merchants in an attempt to prevent british interference.   [ 27 ]    
 fillmore had difficulties regarding  cuba . many southerners wanted to expand slave territory in the u.s., but the missouri compromise and other laws prevented that. cuba was a colony of spain where slavery was practiced. therefore, some of these southerners tried to get cuba annexed to the u.s. as a slave state.   [ 27 ]     venezuelan  adventurer  narciso lópez  recruited americans for three "filibustering" expeditions to cuba, in the hope of overthrowing spanish rule there. his first attempt in 1849 was suppressed by u.s. officials by orders of president taylor. lópez tried again a year later; he reached cuba but was chased away by spanish troops and disbanded his force in  key west . lópez and several of his followers were indicted for breach of the neutrality act, but were quickly acquitted by friendly southern juries.   [ 27 ]    
 many southerners felt fillmore should have supported the invasion, while some northern democrats were upset at his apology to spain. france and britain dispatched warships to the region in response. fillmore sent a stern warning saying that under certain conditions control of cuba "might be almost essential to our [america's] safety."   [ 27 ]    lópez tried a third time in 1851. this time most of his force was captured by the spanish. he and many of his american followers were executed, provoking outrage among american sympathizers and causing further embarrassment for fillmore. 
 another issue that came up during fillmore's presidency was the arrival of  lajos kossuth , the exiled leader of a failed  hungarian  revolution. kossuth wanted the u.s. to recognize hungary's independence. many americans were sympathetic to the hungarian rebels, especially recent german immigrants, who were now coming to the u.s. in large numbers and had become a major political force. this would require the u.s. to abandon its policy of nonintervention in european affairs. fillmore ultimately refused to change american policy, and remained neutral. 
  election of 1852 and completion of term  
 main article:  1852 whig national convention  
 as the  election of 1852  approached, fillmore had been long undecided whether to run for a full term as president. in early 1852, he decided he would. the whigs held their  national convention  in june that year. fillmore was then unpopular with northern whigs for signing and enforcing the fugitive slave act. he led narrowly on the early ballots, but was short of a majority and could gain no votes. on the 52nd ballot, daniel webster's delegates switched to general  winfield scott , winning him the nomination on the 53rd ballot.   [ 28 ]      [ 29 ]      [ 30 ]    
  democrat   franklin pierce  defeated scott in the november election. fillmore completed his term and was succeeded by pierce in march 1853.   [ 31 ]    
  1856 campaign

 when fillmore returned to the u.s., the whig party had broken up over slavery issues and especially the  kansas–nebraska act  of 1854. most former northern whigs, including fillmore's old mentor weed, joined the new  republican party . fillmore instead followed conservative and southern whigs by joining the american party, the political organ of the anti-immigrant, anti-catholic  know-nothing  movement. fillmore was not himself anti-catholic – his daughter mary had attended a girls' catholic boarding school for a year   [ 32 ]    and he contributed to the construction of  st. joseph cathedral  in buffalo   [ 33 ]    – but at this time, the american party was the only alternative for non-democrats who were not militantly anti-slavery. 
 historian  allan nevins  says fillmore was not a know-nothing or a nativist. he was out of the country when the nomination came and had not been consulted about running. furthermore, "by no spoken or written word had he indicated a subscription to american tenets."   [ 34 ]    however he sought national unity and said the american party was the "only hope of forming a truly national party, which shall ignore this constant and distracting agitation of slavery."   [ 35 ]    
 
    
 
    
1856 election results by county explicitly indicating the percentage for fillmore in each county 
 
 
 the american party chose fillmore as its presidential nominee for the  election of 1856 . he thus sought a nonconsecutive second term as president (a feat accomplished only once, by  grover cleveland ). his running mate was  andrew jackson donelson , nephew of former president  andrew jackson .  james buchanan  and  john c. breckinridge  were the democrat candidates, and won 1,836,072 votes (45.3%) and 174 electoral votes (19 states carried).  john c. fremont  and  william l. dayton  were the republican candidates and won 1,342,345 votes (33.1%) and 114 electoral votes (11 states carried). fillmore and donelson finished third, winning 873,053 votes (21.6%) and carrying the state of maryland and its 8 electoral votes. this was one of the best showings ever by a third-party presidential candidate. 
  later life  
 fillmore's wife abigail, who had been unwell for years, died march 30, 1853, less than one month after he left office. 
 fillmore was one of the founders of the  university at buffalo . the school was chartered by an act of the new york state legislature on may 11, 1846, and at first was only a medical school.   [ 36 ]    fillmore was the first  chancellor , a position he held as vice president and as president. after leaving office, fillmore returned to buffalo and continued to serve as chancellor of the school. 
 on july 26, 1854, fillmore's daughter mary died suddenly of  cholera .   [ 37 ]      [ 38 ]    now left alone, fillmore went abroad. while touring europe in 1855, fillmore was offered an  honorary   doctor of civil law  (d.c.l.) degree by the university of oxford. fillmore turned down the honor, explaining that he had neither the "literary nor scientific attainment" to justify the degree.   [ 39 ]    he is also quoted as having explained that he "lacked the benefit of a classical education" and could not, therefore, understand the  latin  text of the diploma, adding that he believed "no man should accept a degree he cannot read."   [ 9 ]    
 on february 10, 1858, fillmore married  caroline mcintosh , a wealthy widow. their combined wealth allowed them to purchase a big house in buffalo, new york. they were noted for lavish hospitality in their home, until mrs. fillmore's health began to decline in the 1860s. 
 fillmore helped found the buffalo historical society (now the  buffalo history museum ) in 1862 and served as its first president. 
 
    
 
    
fillmore during the civil war 
 
 
 in the election of 1860, fillmore supported  constitutional union party  candidate  john bell . he denounced secession, and supported the union war effort, but also became a constant critic of the war policies of president  abraham lincoln , such as the  emancipation proclamation . 
 he commanded the union continentals, a corps of  home guards  of males over the age of 45 from the upstate new york area. the continentals trained to defend the buffalo area in the event of a confederate attack, as happened in the  st. albans raid , and was planned for  johnson's island . they performed military drill and ceremonial functions at parades, funerals, and other events. the union continentals guarded lincoln's funeral train in buffalo. they continued operations after the war, and fillmore remained active with them almost until his death.   [ 40 ]    
  in the 1864 election  fillmore supported  democratic  candidate  george b. mcclellan  for the presidency, believing that the democratic party's plan for immediate cessation of fighting and allowing the seceded states to return with slavery intact was the best possibility for restoring the union.   [ 41 ]    
 fillmore also maintained a correspondence with  franklin pierce , in which they agreed with each other that lincoln had overstepped his authority and encouraged each other to find ways to thwart lincoln's war policy.   [ 42 ]      [ 43 ]    
 fillmore's reputation as a lincoln critic caused a crowd to gather outside his house after lincoln's assassination. spattering his house with ink, they demanded to know why fillmore hadn't draped his house in black bunting as a sign of mourning for lincoln. fillmore asked for understanding, explaining that he was at the bedside of his ill wife, and did not know of lincoln's death. his explanation satisfied the crowd, which soon departed.   [ 44 ]    
 after the war, fillmore maintained his conservative position. he supported president  andrew johnson 's conservative  reconstruction  policies, and opposed the policies of the radical republicans.   [ 45 ]    
 he died at 11:10 pm on march 8, 1874, of the aftereffects of a stroke.   [ 46 ]    his last words were alleged to be, upon being fed some soup, "the nourishment is palatable." on january 7 each year, a ceremony is held at his grave site in the  forest lawn cemetery  in buffalo.

 some northern whigs remained irreconcilable, refusing to forgive fillmore for having signed the fugitive slave act. they helped deprive him of the presidential nomination in 1852. within a few years it was apparent that although the compromise had been intended to settle the slavery controversy, it served rather as an uneasy sectional truce. robert j. rayback argues that the appearance of a truce, at first, seemed very real as the country entered a period of prosperity that included the south.   [ 47 ]    although fillmore, in retirement, continued to feel that conciliation with the south was necessary and considered that the republican party was at least partly responsible for the subsequent disunion, he was an outspoken critic of secession and was also critical of  president james buchanan  for not immediately taking military action when south carolina seceded.   [ 48 ]    
 benson lee grayson suggests that the fillmore administration's ability to avoid potential problems is too often overlooked. fillmore's constant attention to mexico avoided a resumption of the hostilities that had only broken off in 1848 and laid the groundwork for the  gadsden treaty  during pierce's administration.   [ 49 ]    meanwhile, the fillmore administration resolved a serious dispute with  portugal  left over from the taylor administration,   [ 50 ]    smoothed over a disagreement with  peru , and then peacefully resolved other disputes with britain, france, and spain over cuba. at the height of this crisis, the  royal navy  had fired on an american ship while at the same time 160 americans were being held captive in spain. fillmore and his state department were able to resolve these crises without the united states going to war or losing face.   [ 51 ]

 because the whig party was so deeply divided, and the two leading national figures in the whig party (fillmore and his own secretary of state,  daniel webster ) refused to combine to secure the nomination,  winfield scott  received it. because both the north and the south refused to unite behind scott, he won only four of 31 states, and lost the election to  franklin pierce . after scott's defeat, the whigs' decline continued, until the party broke up over the  kansas–nebraska act , and the know nothings appeared. 
 in the history of the u.s. presidency, fillmore inaugurated a new era. all previous presidents had substantial personal fortunes, acquired either by inheritance, marriage, or (in  martin van buren 's case) by work as an attorney. fillmore was the first of a long line of late nineteenth century chief executives, mostly lawyers, who acquired only modest wealth during their lives, were "distinctly middle class", and who spent most of their careers in public service.

  a popular story  claims, incorrectly, that fillmore installed the white house's first bathtub. 
 while fillmore's letters and papers are owned by multiple institutions, including the penfield library of the state university of new york at oswego, the largest surviving collection is in the research library at the  buffalo and erie county historical society .   [ 53 ]    
 on february 18, 2010, the  united states mint  released the thirteenth coin in the  presidential $1 coin program , bearing fillmore's likeness. a total of 74,480,000 coins were produced.   [ 54 ]      [ 55 ]
